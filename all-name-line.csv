0,Narrator,(Breeze) (Meow)
1,Akira,"It's so windy tonight.... Maybe that's why all the cats won't stop meowing. I managed to buy some canned cat food for cheap, so I should drop by the old cat lady's house on the way back. Kuro and Hanako get tuna; Tama gets some chicken, and Tora gets salmon. And senior food for Grandpa Tails. The old cat lady lets me take care of them every now and then because we live close by. Each cat is so cute and unique. Oh, that's right. The old cat lady mentioned something like this.... Mysterious things happen on nights when the wind is strong, the cats are on edge, and the full moon shines bright in the sky."
2,Narrator,(Footsteps)
3,Akira,"Woah.... What a huge full moon.... It looks even brighter than usual. It's so big and bright, I can probably get a nice picture just with my phone camera. Focus and.... Got it."
4,Narrator,(Snap)
5,Narrator,"Once I get a picture of the moon, I head to my apartment's elevator while gazing at my phone. I press the elevator button, wait for it to arrive, and step through the open doors."
6,Narrator,(Elevator doors closing)
7,Akira,Oh. I got a really clear picture of the moon. I'll show it to the old cat lady when I drop by with the canned cat food. ....Huh? Something seems off.
8,Narrator,"I look up from my smartphone, and my eyes widen in surprise. This doesn't look like the elevator in my apartment complex."
9,Narrator,(Elevator sounds)
10,Narrator,"Thump, clatter. The echoing sounds are also unfamiliar."
11,Akira,What's going on...? Was the building undergoing renovations....?
12,???,Hello.
13,Akira,....!?
14,Narrator,I can't believe my eyes. A hat floats in mid-air - and it's speaking to me.
15,???,"Welcome, Sir Sage. Let me escort you to this elevator's destination. I am Murr, a Western wizard. Our destination is a world splintered by the < Great Catastrophe >."
16,Murr,"It's an honor to meet you, my beloved Sir Sage."
17,Akira,Woah....!?
18,Narrator,"A gracious gentleman appears underneath the hat. He pays no attention to my exclamation of surprise, and continues speaking."
19,Murr,"I may soon drag you into a rather cumbersome situation, Sir Sage. Now, there are many cumbersome things in this world. Take, for example, love affairs, prestige, war, family, friends, revenge, repayment.... But this time, the most cumbersome problem of all awaits us! Saving the world - we would like to ask you for your assistance in this matter."
20,Akira,.....Wh.... What's going on.... Am I dreaming.....?
21,Narrator,The young man named Murr smiles in response to my bewilderment.
22,Murr,"We'll be arriving soon. Both the world and I have been torn apart quite terribly, and... You will probably be sorely disappointed in me. But if we could become friends nonetheless - I would be very happy. Oh, brilliant Sage. I have yearned to meet you for so, so long. Truth be told, I don't care about the world at all. Acts of charity are a pain, after all. But..... I want you to discover the truth about this world."
23,Akira,Ah......
24,Narrator,"When Murr disappears, the elevator stops."
25,Narrator,(Ding)
26,Narrator,"Slowly, the doors open....."
27,Man with a fancy beard,Sir Sage....!
28,Akira,Huh.....
29,Man with a fancy beard,The Sage has arrived! The wizards' summoning ritual was a success!
30,Soldier,Cheers for the Sage!
31,Soldier,Cheers!
32,Akira,Huh!? What's going on!?
33,Man with a fancy beard,"Now, now, this way, Sir Sage. Thank you for coming to us. My name is Drummond. I am Central Country's Minister of Magical Affairs."
34,Meek-looking man,"Erm, I'm Cock Robin, the secretary of Central Country."
35,Drummond,"This way, Sir Sage! Let me escort you to the Central castle before those pesky wizards arrive!"
36,Akira,"Huh!? Um, please wait a second. What are you all doing? Is this a prank? Or some new kind of VR experience?"
37,Drummond,"We were waiting for you, Sir Sage! You are going to battle the < Great Catastrophe > and save the world."
38,Akira,"Battle what and save the world!? Is my apartment complex doing some kind of game collaboration? Maybe there's a camera hiding somewhere..... I really can't have this, you know......"
39,Drummond,Do not fear! There's nothing dangerous about this. The pesky wizards are the ones who will be fighting!
40,Akira,Wizards?
41,Drummond,"Yes. But they're a rowdy bunch who never listen to our commands - much like cats. For some reason, they historically only listen to the sage who arrives from another world."
42,Narrator,(Footsteps)
43,Soldier,Sir Drummond! We have news....
44,Drummond,"What!? The wizards!? This is bad. We need to coax the Sage away before they arri..... Ahem! We really need to get close to Sir Sage! Sir Sage, let us hurry to the Central castle!"
45,Akira,Please wait! I don't understand anything at all!
46,Narrator,Surrounded by soldiers - feeling threatened - I shake my head furiously.
47,Akira,"I really don't play RPGs, so I don't know how you want me to react! Please take someone else....."
48,Drummond,You'll come with us even if we have to make you. Soldiers!
49,Akira,........!
50,Narrator,"The moment I try to flee, the soldiers all draw their swords."
51,Cock Robin,"Sir Drummond, this is excessive......"
52,Drummond,Silence! The damn wizards are the ones at fault here!
53,Narrator,"The silver swords approach me with a terrifying glare. The blades shine as if they're real, and I turn pale."
54,Akira,(Oh god! There's something wrong with these people!)
55,Narrator,"In that moment, I spot a shadow approaching us from the sky beyond the window. Two young men, flying through the sky on their broomsticks."
56,Akira,(They're flying through the sky....!?) (Wh.... What in the world? Is the outside scenery part of this VR too....?)
57,Narrator,"I strain my eyes, trying to unveil the trick behind this bizarre sight, when..... They pass through the window and land right in front of my eyes. Whisking up a real breeze."
58,Akira,(Huh....?)
59,Narrator,"They make their brooms vanish in an instant like magic, and stand on either side of me."
60,???,"Your prediction was spot-on, Heath. I didn't think the guys from the Ministry of Magical Affairs would actually come to kidnap the Sage."
61,???,I told you. ....Humans just don't trust us.
62,Narrator,"Surprised, I look at them, one at a time. The tall, fearless young man turns around to look at me. His eyes are of different colors."
63,???,Are you the new Sage?
64,Akira,Huh.....?
65,???,"I'm Cain, a Central wizard. I'm also the knight who will protect you. What's your name?"
66,Akira,Ah.... I'm Akira......
67,Narrator,"When I answer, the young man named Cain turns the corners of his lips upward into a smile."
68,Cain,"Sir Akira. Nice to meet you. Before we do anything else, let's deal with these guys."
69,Narrator,"He laughs boldly and draws his sword. It looks far more splendid than the swords of the other soldiers surrounding us, with fine decorations and a sharpened blade."
70,Akira,(I... Is this sword real....?)
71,Narrator,"As a chill of nervousness runs through my body, the soldiers look just as nervous."
72,Soldier,G-General Cain.....
73,Soldier,It's General Cain....!
74,Drummond,"Arrgh, it's former General Cain! He's no longer your commanding officer! Cain! You will be punished for treason if you keep pointing your sword at me, a minister!"
75,Cain,"I don't like threatening the elderly, you know? But if you're going to do anything funny to our dear Sage, that's another story. Sorry, but I'm not holding back."
76,Soldier,.......gh.
77,Cain,"Hey now, don't flinch. Didn't I teach you not to get overwhelmed by your opponent's spirit? Pull yourselves together and march forward. Even if I'm your opponent. -Now, bring it on."
78,Cain,"Even if I'm your opponent. -Now, bring it on."
79,Soldier,Y-Yessir....!
80,Drummond,Cain! How many times must I tell you! These soldiers here no longer follow your command! I will give their orders!
81,Cain,You're so picky.....
82,Drummond,You're too relaxed! That's why you were chased out of your rank as commanding officer!
83,Cain,"Okay, okay! Have it your way. Just make it quick. Go ahead, Your Excellency."
84,Drummond,"Ahem..... Go, get him.....!"
85,Narrator,(Footsteps)
86,Soldier,Aaaaargh.....!
87,Narrator,The soldiers raise their voices and rush at Cain.
88,Narrator,(Swords clashing)
89,Narrator,"I'm bewildered by the sudden uproar, but Cain battles so dashingly that I can't take my eyes off of him. He dodges soldiers blindly swinging their blades one after another and beats them down with ease."
90,Akira,(Amazing... He's so cool.....)
91,Narrator,That's when somebody's hand timidly tugs at my arm. His fingertips are cold.
92,???,.............
93,Akira,Um.......
94,???,"Ah.... I'm Heathcliff, an Eastern wizard. Please follow me."
95,Narrator,"I take one look at the boy named Heathcliff and my breath is taken away. He's a beautiful boy - more beautiful than anyone I've ever seen on television, or online. He's like a work of art, crafted with the most delicate workmanship. Heathcliff turns his eyes downward, as if to escape my gaze."
96,Heathcliff,This way.
97,Narrator,"I follow Heathcliff to a dark staircase, escaping the floor that has become a total battleground. I feel my anxiety growing - I know there were no spiral staircases in my apartment complex."
98,Akira,"U... Um, can I ask a question?"
99,Narrator,"Heathcliff looks at me over his shoulder as we're halfway down the stairwell. His vivid eyes are like fine jewels. I'm mesmerized for an instant, but my expression soon turns to a frown. Heathcliff looks ill. Upon closer inspection, Cain, who is fighting on the floor above, also looks exhausted."
100,Akira,....Are you okay? You don't look very good. .....Woa....h.
101,Narrator,"Heathcliff staggers out of nowhere, and I quickly reach out to support him. Breathing heavily, Heathcliff rests a hand on his forehead."
102,Heathcliff,....I apologize.... I'm almost entirely out of magic......
103,Akira,....Magic.....?
104,Heathcliff,We just came from our battle with the < Great Catastrophe >...... ....Cain is also at his limit.....
105,Soldier,Don't let them go! Catch them!
106,Heathcliff,...............
107,Narrator,(Footsteps)
108,Narrator,The soldiers come chasing us from the floor above. Heathcliff leads me by the hand and we try to make our way to the lower floor. But a crowd approaches us from below.
109,Soldier,We've caught you in the middle! Now you can't get away!
110,Heathcliff,"....Don't worry, Sir Sage. I will protect you."
111,Akira,But you look so ill.....
112,Narrator,"Heathcliff holds up his hand in front of his chest. A gentle light begins to gather around his hand. Before I can register it, there's a pocket watch in his palm."
113,Akira,(Wh-what was that!?)
114,Narrator,Heathcliff quietly grips the pocket watch and closes his eyes.
115,Heathcliff,<< Repsevaivulp Sonus >>
116,Narrator,In that moment-. The soldiers all freeze up like figurines.
117,Akira,Wh.....!?
118,Heathcliff,......agh.
119,Akira,A-are you okay!?
120,Narrator,"As if overwhelmed by vertigo, Heathcliff falls to one knee. He quickly nods and forces himself to stand back up."
121,Heathcliff,"...I'm all right.... Let's hurry. The magic will come undone in an instant. We need to hurry, or else Mr. Faust will......"
122,Narrator,"I support Heath's back while falling deeper into my confusion. He doesn't look like he's performing for a prank. This looks real. The same goes for the sharpness of the soldier's swords, and for Cain, who hides his exhaustion as he fights on."
123,Cain,"Heath, are you all right!?"
124,Heathcliff,....I'm fine!
125,Akira,"(If it's all real, then......) (What in the world is going on?)"
126,???,"The wind really lingers on your skin tonight. Like the touch of a lover bound to cause future troubles..... The Central tower is within sight. I wonder if Cain and Heathcliff are safe. Come now, stop getting distracted. I'll leave you behind. Murr."
127,Murr,I'm headed over right now!
128,Heathcliff,"This way, Sir Sage."
129,Akira,Yes.....
130,Narrator,"Still in a daze, I follow Heathcliff as we weave our way through the crowd of soldiers, frozen stiff like figurines. We're almost at the bottom of the stairwell when their fingers begin to twitch."
131,Heathcliff,.....The spell is wearing off......
132,Narrator,"In the next moment, the soldiers all begin to move at once."
133,Soldier,....Capture the Sage! Huh? He's gone? Where'd he go!?
134,Soldier,"You idiot, he's right behind you!"
135,Soldier,When did he get there!? We're not letting you go.....!
136,Narrator,(Footsteps)
137,Narrator,The soldiers surround us.
138,Narrator,"That's when a strange-smelling white smoke drifts into the scene from the window at the end of the stairs. It's dazzlingly sweet, akin to wine."
139,Narrator,"I look up in surprise, and there, on the once-empty windowsill, sits a young man. He smiles gently, but there's a mysterious, seductive air to him as well. Perhaps it's because of the long pipe in his mouth."
140,???,Good evening.
141,Heathcliff,Shylock!
142,???,"My goodness, I can't believe you. You and Cain are both pushing yourselves far past your limits.... You must've just barely hung onto your brooms to get here."
143,Heathcliff,"I had to, for Mr. Faust....."
144,???,I know. Leave the rest to us.
145,Narrator,The young man strokes Heathcliff's pale cheek and smiles at me over Heathcliff's shoulder.
146,???,"Pleased to meet you, Sir Sage. I am Shylock, a Western wizard."
147,Akira,....A wizard.....
148,Narrator,I'm shaken again; Shylock gives me a refined smile. He seductively brings the pipe to his lips.
149,Soldier,A-another wizard!
150,Soldier,D-don't let him scare you! They should've used up all their power in the battle against the < Great Catastrophe >....!
151,Narrator,"Shylock simply breathes out a puff of smoke from his pipe. And the white smoke fills the room with a sweet, intoxicating scent. The soldiers all suddenly stumble on their feet - it's as if they're drunk."
152,Soldier,"Hehe..... Huh.....? Hey, isn't this kinda fun......?"
153,Soldier,Heheh...... This bed looks real comfy......... I'll just go to sleep......
154,Narrator,"Before I know it, the soldiers are all falling to the floor wearing delighted expressions. Shylock crosses his legs up high and brings his pipe away from his lips."
155,Shylock,Sweet dreams.
156,Narrator,That's when Cain comes rushing down towards us from the stairs.
157,Cain,"Shylock, you saved us!"
158,Shylock,"You owe me one, all right? Treat me to a drink next time."
159,Cain,"Just one drink? I'll stick around for the whole night. Sir Sage, let's go."
160,Narrator,"Cain offers me his hand, but I can't take it right away. I'm unsure of whether or not I should take his hand; my gaze wavers."
161,Akira,(Let's go? Go where? Who are these people? Where am I?)
162,Narrator,"Cain doesn't miss the brief flash of anxiety in my expression, and stops in his tracks. He shows no sign of exhaustion as he nods to me, gently and sincerely."
163,Cain,"Ah.... My bad. The sage comes from another world, right? That means you have no idea what's going on. Of course you'd be scared - we're asking you to come with us when you don't even know where you are. ....Umm....."
164,Shylock,Cain. We don't have time for you to explain everything about this world and the sage's role in it all.
165,Cain,I know. But a knight doesn't go about whisking clueless people away without explaining anything to them.
166,Narrator,Cain thinks for a moment before looking straight into my eyes.
167,Cain,"Akira. Let me give you the simple explanation. We need your power, and we'd like you to lend it to us. Why? Because we suffered a terrible loss. We were completely destroyed in an annual battle that we'd easily won every prior year. We were neither careless nor neglectful. The old guy back there is angry because he thinks we did a half-hearted job. But that's not true. We didn't even know what was happening - and we lost the battle, along with half of our comrades. I don't want to lose anything else..... That's why we need your help. Of course, that's just our selfish desire. This isn't your world, and I'm sure there are other things that you would rather be doing. You have the right to refuse, and nobody will blame you for making that choice. But we..... We truly need you. If you're willing to come with us and lend us your power, then I'm willing to do anything. I will show you my utmost courage and sincerity; I will express my utmost gratitude and courtesy. This vow may be nothing but words - but I beg of you: Please, believe in us, and lend us your strength."
168,Narrator,"I don't really understand what Cain is saying. But I truly feel his earnest sincerity from his words and gaze. I can't tell if I'm living in a dream or a simulated reality, but I can tell that his feelings are real. If I take his words seriously, someone on the other end of the camera might laugh at me. But I have to lend him an ear."
169,Akira,...How am I supposed to lend you my strength?
170,Heathcliff,We want you to.... We want you to save Mr. Faust.
171,Akira,Mr. Faust....?
172,Cain,He's our comrade. He's on the brink of death. But you might be able to save him.
173,Akira,On the brink of death...? Why....
174,Shylock,He was gravely injured while protecting a comrade.
175,Heathcliff,"....Mr. Faust is my teacher..... If he hadn't been there for me, I would've died....."
176,Narrator,A comrade on the brink of death..... I repeat those words in my mind. I still don't understand what's going on. But I can understand the deep sadness reflected in Heathcliff's reddened eyes.
177,Heathcliff,"....Please, I beg of you.... Please save him....."
178,Narrator,I take a deep breath and nod.
179,Akira,I understand.... If there's anything I can do to help.
180,Narrator,"A smile of relief spreads across Heathcliff's face. I'm in awe; I didn't realize he was a boy who could smile like this - with such pure, childlike innocence."
181,Heathcliff,"Thank you, Sir Sage......"
182,Drummond,Wait! You damn wizards! I won't let you have the Sage....!
183,Narrator,"The bearded man and the meek-looking young man yell as they rush down the stairwell. The old man looks at me and shouts, as if chiding me:"
184,Drummond,"Sir Sage! You mustn't be fooled! Wizards are all irresponsible liars! They remorselessly deceive humans, and manipulate our hearts with strange powers! You must not believe the wizards!"
185,Narrator,"I turn around to look at the three of them. Cain furrows his brows in frustration, and Heathcliff looks visibly hurt. Shylock alone is smiling. He tilts his head and lets his pipe sway in his hand."
186,Shylock,"Let's say that we are honest, and telling the truth. That would then make you a liar. In fact, you would be the very ""irresponsible liar"" you spoke of just moments ago."
187,Drummond,I serve my country! I am nothing like you frivolous lot!
188,Shylock,"Silence, Sir Drummond. You may think you are speaking with us, but you have no intention of holding a real conversation. The only feeling your words convey is the fact that you do not seem to be very fond of us. You would not believe our words even if they were true. And if we do lie, you would sigh a breath of relief. For you wish to believe that we - the wizards you so detest - are all liars. Then does it matter anymore what is true or what is false?"
189,Drummond,"....Aargh, quit with the word games! In any case, Sir Sage! You must not lend an ear to these wizards! You simply need to listen to us! I'm saying this for your own sake, Sir Sage!"
190,Narrator,"I frown at those words. The old man claims to be speaking in my best interests, but the only thing he's been telling me is to listen to him. Cain asked me to help him - for his own sake and his comrades - even if it might not be in my best interest. I turn around to look at Cain."
191,Akira,I still don't understand what's going on.... But I will follow you.
192,Akira,I still don't understand what's going on.... But I will follow you.
193,Cain,Really!?
194,Heathcliff,Are you sure!?
195,Shylock,"Don't act so surprised, both of you. Sir Sage decided to believe in us; we should be happy."
196,Narrator,"Shylock laughs wryly. Hearing that, Cain and Heathcliff also break out into smiles."
197,Cain,"We are happy. I'm just in awe - a human chose to believe in wizards, even though we only just met."
198,Heathcliff,"Thank you so much, Sir Sage! I will never forget your kindness!"
199,Drummond,"Y-you... Do you realize what a mistake you're making!? Listen to me - wizards are wicked, arrogant, and selfish....."
200,Heathcliff,Say one more word and this wicked wizard will curse you.
201,Drummond,..........
202,Heathcliff,"These wicked and arrogant wizards are the ones who fought to protect this world. My teacher, my comrades - they fought and fell to protect the likes of you!"
203,Drummond,Th.... That's......
204,Cock Robin,"S-Sir, you've gone too far."
205,Drummond,"Why are you taking their side!? All right then, I'm going to take you down by force!"
206,Shylock,Oh? How? Everyone seems to have departed to the land of dreams.
207,Drummond,"Heheh.... You fools! There are soldiers waiting for you outside! You won't stand a chance against them, knowing how exhausted you are! It's a massive army, equipped with weapons of magical technology....."
208,???,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
209,Akira,.......!?
210,Narrator,(Pop)
211,Narrator,"Suddenly, the old man disappears."
212,Narrator,"And in his place stands a mouse, surrounded by his clothes."
213,Mouse,Squeak! Squeak!
214,Narrator,"A young man climbs in through the window, picks the mouse up by its tail, and grins."
215,???,Meo~w. I'm gonna eat you.
216,Narrator,I hold my breath in surprise. Because he's the young man I just met in the elevator.
217,Shylock,"What have you been doing all this time, Murr?"
218,Murr,I was busy saying goodbye to the moon!
219,Cain,To the moon? You're as crazy as ever.
220,Narrator,"I'm bewildered. His name and face are the same, but he seems like a completely different person from the man I met earlier. Earlier, he was a brilliant gentleman; now, he's like a mischievous stray cat."
221,Heathcliff,We can talk later. Everyone hurry!
222,Murr,Got it!
223,Mouse,Squeak~! Squeak!
224,Narrator,"Murr hurls the mouse through the air, and Cock Robin scrambles to catch it."
225,Cock Robin,"Um, about the minister....."
226,Shylock,He'll turn back to normal after half a day.
227,Murr,"Hi, Sir Sage, I'm the Western wizard Murr! Have you ever flown?"
228,Akira,Flown....!? Huh....!?
229,Murr,Then come with me! This way!
230,Akira,Whoa....!?
231,Cain,"Stop, Murr!"
232,Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
233,Narrator,"When Murr utters those mysterious words-. Out of nowhere, a broomstick appears in his hand. He grabs it with one hand and pulls my arm by the other. And we leap out of the closest window."
234,Akira,.....!?
235,Narrator,"My body floats into the air. And in the next moment, we plummet at a great speed."
236,Akira,Aaaa....h!
237,Narrator,"The cold night air rushes towards my body. As I fall headfirst from a tall, tall tower. A likewise upside-down but smiling Murr appears in front of my eyes as I scream."
238,Murr,"Hey, hey, do you think you're gonna die? How does that feel? Is it thrilling? Is it exciting?"
239,Cain,"Murr, that's enough! What are we going to do if something happens to Sir Sage!?"
240,Murr,What will we do?
241,Cain,Don't ask me!
242,Murr,"Fine, I get it! Sir Sage, hang onto me!"
243,Narrator,(Woosh)
244,Narrator,"I grab onto Murr's arm, and he nimbly hops onto his broomstick. The next moment, we're speeding upwards high into the night sky. We're soaring through the wind and flying through the starlit night. Fearfully, I turn my eyes downward and see nothing but unfamiliar woods and castles sprawling across the land below."
245,Akira,....Where.....!?
246,Murr,Did you lose something? Have you checked the insides of your pockets?
247,Akira,"W-where is Tokyo, Japan!?"
248,Murr,Who knows? Why don't you look for a new one? Here we go~!
249,Narrator,(Woosh)
250,Cain,"Murr! Don't be so reckless! You're carrying the Sage with you, you know!?"
251,Narrator,"I cling to Murr's body as we cut against the cold air, flying through the sky like a bird. I turn around and spot a tower - much like the Tokyo Tower - glittering within the pitch-black night. We had leapt out of that tower. As we flee through the sky, my heart races with both fear and excitement. I know people who fly on broomsticks. They're wizards."
252,Akira,(Don't tell me.... They're real wizards!?)
253,Cain,.....! Careful! It's the << Trail of Flowershards >> !
254,Heathcliff,"A cluster of flower petals, spreading through the entire night sky like a high wave..... Is this the << Trail of Flowershards >> which appears when the world is restoring itself!? Should we go around it....!?"
255,Murr,"Let's dive right into it! You want to touch it too, right, Sir Sage!"
256,Akira,You can touch it!?
257,Cain,"Hey, hey, hey, hold on!"
258,Shylock,"Stop it, Murr."
259,Murr,It's fine! Come on! Just reach out!
260,Akira,.....Ah......
261,Narrator,"A glittering wave of rainbow flower petals draws close to me. I reach out, my heart racing. The moment my fingertips brush a petal, it bursts into a sparkling powder and dissipates like magic dust."
262,Akira,.....!
263,Heathcliff,...It's beautiful......
264,Shylock,Is everyone all right?
265,Cain,Yeah. What an amazing sight......
266,Murr,"Ahahaha! See, aren't you glad you touched it? Life is a journey! You'll meet countless, wonderful, once-in-a-lifetime experiences."
267,Narrator,Their bodies shine with light; it's as if we're dancing with the galaxy as their laughter echoes through the night. And we fly on to our destination.
268,Oz,............
269,Snow,Oz.
270,White,"Hey, Oz."
271,Oz,Snow. White.
272,Snow,How is Faust doing?
273,White,Can we save him?
274,Snow,You're the strongest wizard amongst all of us.
275,White,"If you can't save him, no one else can."
276,Oz,"My magic hasn't returned yet. They're suppressing his pain with herbs for now. If you have any parting words, go tell him now."
277,Snow,You're so cold......
278,White,This is so sad......
279,Oz,"............ If the Sage makes it in time, or......"
280,Snow,Oh? It's the Northern wizards.
281,White,Hey. Where are you all going?
282,Mithra,We've played our part.
283,Snow,Mithra. Your comrade is on the brink of death.
284,Mithra,Huh...... Is that so.
285,White,What an unconcerned reply.
286,Snow,You're an even colder man than Oz.
287,Mithra,I'm free now that I've fulfilled my role. It's up to me to decide where I want to go.
288,White,"You too, Owen?"
289,Owen,"Fufu...... The world almost ended, you say? Everyone must be crying their eyes out from loss and terror. I have to go and see for myself. It's going to be so much fun."
290,White,"As always, you're a bad boy."
291,Owen,"Haha...... Are you going to punish me? The scary, scary twin teachers of the North."
292,Snow,"Even if we smack you on the bottom, your nature won't change."
293,White,You really won't change.
294,Owen,I'm glad we're on the same page. Well then.
295,Narrator,(Footsteps)
296,White,"There he goes...... Hmm? What's wrong, Mithra?"
297,Mithra,Nothing. Owen just beat me to it......
298,White,Did you miss your chance to walk away?
299,Snow,"You might be impudent, but you're still a charming child."
300,Mithra,Huh. Thanks.
301,Bradley,......Taking my chance now......
302,Snow,"Hold on, Bradley!"
303,Bradley,Got caught! ......Ugh!
304,White,You don't get to walk away freely.
305,Snow,"You're a prisoner, after all. We have to return you to your cell."
306,White,Prisoners should stay put behind bars.
307,Bradley,"Fuck! Let go, you geezers!"
308,Snow,We're not geezers~.
309,White,"Yeah, we aren't geezers~."
310,Bradley,"Stop pretending to be kids, you fucking geezers!"
311,Snow & White,Tee hee!
312,Mithra,Oz.
313,Oz,............
314,Mithra,"You call yourself the strongest wizard in the world, yet you were as useless as an infant in the face of the < Great Catastrophe > this time."
315,Oz,.........It's not like I call myself that.
316,Mithra,"I'll overthrow you someday, and claim the title of the world's strongest wizard for myself. Please prepare yourself for that day."
317,Oz,"If you hadn't been summoned as a Sage's wizard, I would've killed you by now."
318,Mithra,...........
319,Oz,Leave.
320,Mithra,"See you another time, then."
321,Narrator,(Footsteps)
322,Oz,............
323,White,So Mithra left as well......
324,Snow,Oz. Mithra left you with a parting shot.
325,White,"You weren't paying attention, so he used you to stage his exit."
326,Oz,......Enough.
327,Snow,Where are you going?
328,Oz,I'm going to Faust.
329,Snow,"That's right, how sad......"
330,White,How very sad......
331,Bradley,......Faust...... Is there nothing we can do for that Eastern curseworker?
332,Snow,Without the Sage here......
333,White,There's nothing we can do if the Sage isn't here.....
334,Faust,"......hh, ......hh......"
335,White,Faust.
336,Snow,Have you any desires?
337,Faust,"......hh, ......haa...... Desires......? I have none......"
338,Bradley,"Don't hold back, Eastern curseworker. You don't have to play all selfless even in your final moments."
339,Faust,............
340,Bradley,"I've never really liked the Eastern wizards, they're all so gloomy and depressing - you especially since you work in curses, but...... You're an idiot, risking your life like that for your comrades - but I don't hate idiots like you."
341,White,Bradley......
342,Snow,"You're a good boy, Bradley."
343,Bradley,"Shut up! Don't call me a good boy. I'm a Northern wizard - the kind that strikes fear into crying children - and the boss of the strongest, most vicious gang of bandits there's ever been."
344,Snow,"Does anything come to mind, Faust?"
345,White,You heard Bradley. Don't hold back.
346,Faust,............ No..... Those frivolous humans will find a way to destroy themselves without me having to lift a finger...... ......Serves them right...... It's what they deserve...... Heheheh...... Hahahahaha......
347,Bradley,"............ Yeah, he really is gloomy and depressing......"
348,Snow,"Shh, keep quiet."
349,White,"Looking back on Faust's life, it's no surprise that his hatred for humans runs so deep......"
350,Faust,............ ......This interminable life will finally come to an end......
351,Oz,......Faust......
352,Faust,"......I'll finally be released...... God, I pray you grant me freedom......"
353,Oz,............ ............?
354,Bradley,"What's wrong, Oz?"
355,Oz,......I sense the Sage's presence......
356,Murr,We've arrived!
357,Akira,......Uuugh......
358,Murr,Hmm? Sir Sage?
359,Shylock,"Oh my, Sir Sage. Are you quite all right? Are you dizzy from the journey?"
360,Akira,"I......, I'm fine......."
361,Cain,"You fly so recklessly, Murr. Here, give me your hand, Sir Sage. This way!"
362,Heathcliff,Mr. Faust......!
363,Narrator,(Door opens)
364,Akira,............!
365,Narrator,"I open the door to find a young man lying in a bed, quietly surrounded by a group of people. The young man, who Heathcliff called Mr. Faust, has a bloodless face that looks as pale as wax. Poisonous-looking fumes rise from beneath the layers of bandages wrapped around his body, throwing off the occasional spark. My breath catches: the situation was even more dire than I imagined."
366,Snow,Is it the Sage!?
367,White,The Sage has arrived!
368,Bradley,This guy is the Sage? Are you for real?
369,Oz,............
370,Narrator,"I stiffen nervously under the scrutiny of so many people. In particular, the man standing in the middle of the group has a terrifying presence about him; his gaze alone could freeze someone where they stand. His eyes, like a merciless blizzard, hold no warmth in them. But the moment he catches sight of me, that cold and terrifying gaze softens into an expression of relief. As if he had been waiting for me."
371,Oz,......You made it in time......
372,Shylock,How is Faust holding up? Is he still alive?
373,Faust,......Unfortunately so......
374,Shylock,What a relief. We lost exactly ten wizards in this battle against the < Great Catastrophe >. I personally find eleven an unwieldy final count. Faust.
375,Heathcliff,Mr. Faust......!
376,Narrator,"Heathcliff clings to the side of the bed, peering into the face of the injured man. The man - Faust - opens his eyes slightly."
377,Faust,......Heathcliff......?
378,Heathcliff,It's all right now! The Sage has come! He'll save you!
379,Faust,.....Are you hurt anywhere......?
380,Heathcliff,"......Um, ......No......"
381,Faust,.....I see......
382,Narrator,"For a moment, I think I catch a glimpse of Faust's lips turning upwards into a smile."
383,Faust,......Thank goodn......
384,Narrator,"But before his smile can fully form, Faust's movements slacken, then stop. His fingers, which were about to clasp Heathcliff's hand, fall limply to the bed."
385,Narrator,(Rustle)
386,Narrator,"Faust lays there unmoving, his eyes still wide open and staring."
387,Heathcliff,"Mr. Faust......! No, please don't die!"
388,Snow,This is bad! He's not breathing!
389,White,"Hurry, Sage!"
390,Oz,Sage.
391,Narrator,The man with the terrifying gaze murmurs to me in a voice as quiet as the dark of the night.
392,Oz,Your hand.
393,Narrator,He stretches out a hand to me.
394,Oz,My name is Oz. I am a Central wizard. Lend me your strength.
395,Akira,............
396,Narrator,"I hesitate, and then place my palm over Oz's hand. The moment Oz's cold fingertips close over my hand, a small wind blows across the room."
397,Narrator,(Woosh)
398,Akira,Woah......!
399,Narrator,"The mysterious wind grows stronger, flowing and whirling through our hair and clothes. A white light radiates from Oz's body, starting from the center of our clasped hands. Oz chants a curious string of words."
400,Oz,<< Vox Nox >>
401,Akira,............!
402,Narrator,"In that moment, the faint light shines brilliantly, and disappears into Faust's body."
403,Snow,We did it!
404,White,We really did!
405,Heathcliff,The fumes from Mr. Faust's body are vanishing!
406,Cain,"Let's call his name! Faust, Faust......!"
407,Shylock,"Pull yourself together, Faust."
408,Murr,"Wake up, Faust! It's too early to fall asleep just yet!"
409,Bradley,Open your eyes! Eastern curseworker!
410,Oz,............
411,Faust,"............ ......h, hh......"
412,Narrator,"Faust's eyelids - previously wide open and unmoving - close tightly. His body is wracked with pain, as if time has rewound."
413,Faust,......How cruel...... I thought I would finally get to die......
414,Narrator,"It seems like we've managed to save him. As I breathe out in relief, the room erupts into cheers."
415,Cain,He regained consciousness! Thank goodness......!
416,Murr,Congratulations!
417,Shylock,"My my, what a relief."
418,Bradley,Haha. You're a tough one.
419,Heathcliff,"Mr. Faust...... I'm so glad...... ......Sniff, sniffle......"
420,Snow,That was really close.
421,White,What a relief. That was truly nerve-wracking.
422,Oz,............
423,Narrator,"Oz releases my hand before I even realize it. The twins approach me, as I feel drained from exhaustion."
424,Snow,"You worked hard, Sage."
425,White,It's thanks to you that Faust was saved.
426,Narrator,I shake my head limply.
427,Akira,"I didn't do anything...... All I did was stand here. But if I could help, then I'm glad."
428,Heathcliff,That's not true.
429,Narrator,"Heathcliff turns around to look at me. He gazes at me steadily, his eyes still faintly blurred with tears."
430,Heathcliff,Sir Sage...... You chose to listen to us instead of the minister of Central Country. ......And you came along with us. That's why Mr. Faust was saved. Thank you...... I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart.
431,Narrator,"Heathcliff gives me a reserved smile. It is an awkward, but warm smile; I feel Heathcliff's gratitude. I breathe a sigh of relief, and smile back at him."
432,Narrator,"Faust loses consciousness once again, falling into a deep sleep this time. Things seem to be settling down when I catch the movement of a shadow: Oz is wordlessly turning to leave the room."
433,Snow,Oz.
434,White,Where are you going?
435,Oz,I've fulfilled my duty.
436,Cain,"Hang on. Shouldn't we discuss what to do for the battle against the < Great Catastrophe > next year? No one could have predicted the damage that we suffered this time. I want us to be prepared for when the < Great Catastrophe > attacks next year, so we don't have to go through the same tragedy. We need your strength, Oz."
437,Oz,I refuse.
438,Cain,"Don't be so cold...... Aren't we both Central wizards? I know that you don't get close to other people. But if we don't want to lose to the same enemy twice, we should develop our battle strategy by getting to know each other's strengths."
439,Oz,"Young wizards like to gather in groups. There is no meaning to working together. Only those who can survive should survive. If you don't want to be eliminated, then acquire the strength it takes to survive on your own."
440,Cain,......I don't think that way. There are comrades that we wouldn't have lost if only we had joined forces.
441,Oz,You're dreaming.
442,Cain,............
443,Oz,You cannot change destiny.
444,Narrator,"Cain doesn't say anything more. Everyone watches Oz's retreating figure wordlessly, as if they're afraid of something."
445,Narrator,(Door closes)
446,Narrator,"After Oz leaves, the twins start to murmur."
447,Snow,"My, my. What a thing to say...... Even though he's the one who changed destiny with brute force."
448,Cain,Huh?
449,White,"Don't worry about it, we're just musing aloud. I think there's a point in what you said, Cain."
450,Snow,I agree. We expected nothing less from the man who commanded the knights in Central Country.
451,Cain,Thanks. But we won't get anywhere until we get Oz on our side. He's the one most suited to keeping all of us in line.
452,Bradley,.....I'll pass.
453,Cain,Why?
454,Bradley,You're asking why? Who would go against Oz's orders? He'd crush you like a tomato if you even dared to defy him.
455,Cain,"That's why he's perfect for the role. Mithra, Owen, even a prisoner like you - all of you listen to Oz, right?"
456,Heathcliff,Mithra...... Owen...... Those two are scary......
457,Shylock,"If you're looking for someone who's powerful enough to subdue the two of them with magic, then it'd have to be Oz."
458,Bradley,"What do you have to say, you geezers."
459,Snow,"Ohoho. We've already retired, after all."
460,White,Let the elderly retire from the fighting.
461,Bradley,You only bring up your age when it's convenient for you......
462,Akira,(It seems like everyone wants Oz to lend them his strength.) (Even so......)
463,Narrator,"I look slowly around the room. As the situation settles down, the anxiety that I had been pushing away rears its head."
464,Akira,"(What on earth is happening......? I don't think I'm being filmed, not anymore...... And it doesn't feel like I'm dreaming......)"
465,Narrator,"I slap my own cheeks with all my strength, thinking that it might wake me up."
466,Narrator,(Slap)
467,Akira,Ouch......
468,Heathcliff,Sir Sage!?
469,Bradley,Why are you hitting yourself!?
470,Akira,......This really isn't a dream......
471,Snow,The previous sage pinched his own cheeks too.
472,Akira,The previous sage......?
473,White,That's right: the sage who came before you.
474,Snow,I'll show you something nice.
475,White,Come with us.
476,Akira,......But......
477,Snow,"You don't have to be scared. Here, I'll hold your hand."
478,White,You must be feeling helpless.
479,Akira,Ah...... Thank you......
480,Narrator,"Snow and White each take one of my hands, and lead me out of the room."
481,Akira,"Um, Mister Snow, Mister White......"
482,Snow,You don't have to speak so formally to us - that's the kind of position that the Sage has.
483,Akira,"Well then...... Snow, White. Where are you taking me?"
484,White,To where the sage's manuals are.
485,Narrator,Snow and White bring me to a library filled with countless books. I'm overwhelmed by the sheer weight of history and knowledge contained in the room.
486,Akira,......This is......
487,Snow,These are all the sages' books.
488,Akira,All of it......?
489,White,That's right. They're writings left behind by sages who come to this world from another world.
490,Snow,This is the manual written by the previous sage.
491,White,It's written in a language that we can't read. Can you read it?
492,Narrator,"I grow nervous as they hand me a heavy, splendid-looking book. I flip open the first page, my heart beating fast. What greets me on the page is - Japanese."
493,Narrator,(Flips page)
494,Narrator,"""How do I get back to Japan? I want to go back to Tokyo...... I want to eat ramen and oden and curry......"""
495,Akira,(......This is......) (So this really isn't a dream......?)
496,Narrator,(Flips page)
497,Narrator,"I flip to the next page in a hurry as my agitation continues to spike. Following the diary-like entries, I reach a line, written in a shaky hand, that crushes my heart."
498,Narrator,"""It's no use. I can't go back."" ""I have to stay here for the rest of my life."" ""I've been tricked by the wizards."""
499,Narrator,(Tricked?) I turn pale and look towards the twins.
500,Snow,Hmm?
501,White,Hmm~?
502,Snow,What's wrong?
503,White,So you can't read it?
504,Narrator,I'm terrified and lost for words as they approach me with smiles on their faces.
505,Akira,"(""I can't go back""? ""I've been tricked by the wizards""?) (Will that happen to me too....?)"
506,Narrator,"The twins look at each other, then back at me, smiling brightly."
507,Snow,What's wrong? You're making such a childlike face.
508,White,"If you're a child, then we'll become adults."
509,Snow & White,On the count of three......
510,Narrator,"The twins chant in unison, their hands clasped together."
511,Narrator,"Then, they start to rise and grow taller, like bamboo shoots on a rainy day. They look down at me, in the form of slender young men."
512,Snow,"Here, Sage."
513,White,Shall I pat your head?
514,Narrator,"Snow and White might have taken on adult forms in order to comfort me. Until moments ago, a part of me had been enjoying this strange world of magic. But the moment I discover that I can't go back, the shock of seeing the twins turn into adults becomes too much for me to handle......"
515,Narrator,(Slump)
516,Narrator,And I sink to the ground.
517,Snow,Sage!?
518,White,What's wrong!?
519,Akira,Ah....... But you're.... children......
520,Snow,Changing form is child's play.
521,White,Did we startle you too much?
522,Narrator,"I furrow my brows, and ask the question I'm scared of voicing aloud."
523,Akira,......Have you been tricking me......?
524,Narrator,Snow and White smile curiously.
525,Snow,We're not. Our true forms are those of children.
526,White,"Wizards live for a long time. Once we reach the height of our powers, our bodies simply stop aging."
527,Snow,But it feels good to change into adults occasionally.
528,White,What do you think? I'd say we're a rather handsome pair.
529,Narrator,"As if sensing my distress, Snow and White each take a seat next to me, gripping my hands wordlessly."
530,Snow,"Apologies, Sage. We're twins; we aren't familiar with loneliness."
531,White,"We held your hands, thinking you might be feeling helpless, but we cannot truly comprehend the loneliness you feel."
532,Snow,Poor child...... You must want to go home.
533,White,We don't know how to return you to your world either. I'm sorry that we can't be of any help.
534,Narrator,"I can feel the warmth in their comforting words, and in their gazes. I'm reminded of the faces of my family and friends, and warmth wells up in my chest. The two of them tighten their grip on my hands."
535,Snow,"Let's stay like this, until your heart calms down."
536,White,"We're twins, so we aren't familiar with loneliness. But we encountered it for the first time when we lost each other."
537,Akira,......Lost each other?
538,Snow,White is dead. He's no longer of this world - he's a ghost.
539,Narrator,"I look at White in disbelief. White continues smiling at me, the weight of his hand on mine still so tangible. And yet......"
540,White,That's right. I'm no longer alive. Snow simply tied my soul to his to preserve this afterimage of me.
541,Snow,"That loneliness was more than I alone could bear. You're an incredible child: you're all on your own, yet you do not react by hurting others."
542,White,"You must be lonely, and scared. And yet you still saved Faust. Let me thank you once again."
543,Narrator,"I press my mouth into a firm line. I don't want to doubt their kind voices. I gently disentangle our clasped hands and reopen the book, hoping that I've misread something. I turn to the page after ""I've been tricked by the wizards."""
544,Narrator,(Flip)
545,Narrator,"Written there is - ""It was a misunderstanding."""
546,Akira,You're so misleading......!
547,Snow,Wh-what's wrong?
548,White,Is there something strange written in it?
549,Narrator,"""Turns out they weren't trying to trick me. I just got depressed and became suspicious. Sorry to all the wizards. Seriously, my bad!"""
550,Akira,"(The previous sage...... He seems like a pretty laid-back guy) Um...... What kind of person was he, the previous sage who wrote this book?"
551,Snow,He was a dark-haired man who was clever and fond of talking.
552,Snow,It seemed to be a rare treasure that was hard to obtain in the previous sage's guild.
553,Akira,(.......Did he work at some exploitative company?)
554,Narrator,"""I've been searching all over for a way to get home, but I have yet to come across any solutions, so I made this manual for whoever comes after me."" ""At my company, my previous supervisor quit and left without transitioning his job over properly, so I deeply understand the importance of having a manual."" ""I can only write in Japanese, so I'm sorry about that. This is probably the first manual written in Japanese so far."" ""I found one that seemed to be written in ancient Japanese, but the only word I could read was ‘season,' so I put it away. It's the scrolls on the top shelf."" ""By the way, the sage's manual written by the sage before me is definitely in Arabic no matter how I look at it, but I couldn't read it either, so that was the end of that. "" ""I always left the English e-mails to my juniors at work, so that was it for the English manuals too."" ""The English manuals are collected on the shelves in the western end of the library, and shelved in the middle section. For your reference."""
555,Narrator,"After that, the manual becomes a mix of diary-like entries and more manual-like entries. As I flip through the pages, the words ""Good news!!!"" decorated with a huge flower mark leap out at me."
556,Narrator,"""How to return to my previous world"" ""Arthur, the prince of Central Country, said he'd help me look for a way home. He's a good kid. Kinda like a baby brother. Cute, too."""
557,Akira,......Prince Arthur......
558,Snow,Do you know Arthur?
559,Akira,"Oh, oh no...... The previous sage wrote about him in this book. Do the two of you know him?"
560,White,We know him very well. Arthur is a good-natured child. He was rather concerned about the previous sage.
561,Akira,H-how do I meet Prince Arthur?
562,Narrator,Snow and White look at each other with a smile.
563,Snow,"Arthur is the prince of Central Country. If you had gone along with the minister, you would have met him immediately."
564,White,How was the minister? Was he angry that you came to the magic headquarters?
565,Akira,He was......
566,Snow & White,We thought as much.
567,Akira,Also...... Murr turned him into a mouse.
568,Snow,Ohoho. He must be pretty infuriated.
569,White,Though we do not fear the wrath of mere humans.
570,Narrator,I laugh at their pleased faces. And convey my thanks to them once more.
571,Akira,Thank you for staying by my side. I was slightly shaken...... I'm sorry for behaving so rudely.
572,Snow,"There, there. The most important thing here is for you to feel at ease."
573,White,"We've only just met, and you've only just arrived in this world. It's natural for you to be incredibly anxious."
574,Akira,Well...... I want to return to my own world. That's why I want to meet Prince Arthur.
575,Narrator,Snow and White smile at me sadly.
576,Snow,"Is that so...... We had hoped you would stay, but......"
577,White,Of course you yearn for your family and friends. We'll try to arrange for you to meet Arthur.
578,Akira,Thank you......
579,Snow,"You can try asking Cain, since he's from the same country as Arthur. He's a knight of Central Country."
580,White,"Surely even Cain must be worn out by today's events, so let's give him tonight to get some rest. Ask him tomorrow."
581,Akira,Ask Cain...... I got it.
582,Snow,You should rest up as well. We'll show you to the sage's room.
583,Akira,Thank you. Can I take this book with me?
584,White,"The sage's manual? It belongs to the sage, so of course."
585,Snow,This is the room that the previous sage used.
586,White,"It's still slightly messy, but feel free to tidy it up as you please. Rest up."
587,Akira,I see...... Thank you.
588,Snow,Good night.
589,White,Good night.
590,Akira,Good night.
591,Narrator,(Door closes)
592,Akira,............
593,Narrator,"Left on my own, I take a look around the room. It has a well lived-in air, with traces of its past owner scattered here and there. Unable to fall asleep, I lay open the sage's manual on the bed."
594,Narrator,(Flip)
595,Narrator,I find a sense of comfort in reading the words of someone who once faced the same situation that I now find myself in. It would take a considerable amount of time for me to look through the entire manual.
596,Narrator,(Flip)
597,Narrator,"So, I open up the page with Arthur's name which mentions how to return home, and start reading intently."
598,Narrator,"""When I asked Prince Arthur, he got the palace chefs to make me something close to ramen. It was so good, I cried a little."" ""Prince Arthur brought me good news. Apparently a long time ago there were people who could travel back and forth between their own worlds and this one."" ""Prince Arthur is so easy to get along with. Life at the magic headquarters would be so much more enjoyable if he were one of the wizards here."" ""But Oz would probably never allow it. He always disappears somewhere when Arthur comes to visit, and never ever shows his face."""
599,Akira,............ Do Oz and Prince Arthur not get along......?
600,Narrator,"I feel drowsiness wash over me as I continue to read, so I close the manual. So there were people who could travel between my world and this world. That knowledge alone brings me relief. The fragrance of herbs wafts over from the corner of the room, and a gentle breeze stirs outside the window. Moonlight, almost blindingly bright, floods into the room."
601,Akira,This world's moon is so huge...... It looks like it might almost fall to the ground......
602,Narrator,"Before long, I fall asleep."
603,Murr,"Sigh..... Even though we finally met - I'm sad we have to say goodbye so soon. Goodbye, my radiant beloved....."
604,Shylock,Murr. You are the only person who would pine for the < Great Catastrophe > with such longing.
605,Murr,Shylock.
606,Shylock,"Wasn't the calamity that just befell us entirely your doing? -The heretic wizard Murr, who fell in love with the < Great Catastrophe >?"
607,Murr,............
608,Shylock,"You yearned for the < Great Catastrophe > so desperately that your soul shattered to pieces. Yet you have learned nothing, and continue to pine for the moon."
609,Murr,I can't help it! I love shiny things.
610,Shylock,"...Even if those shiny things are tied to the calamity that will end this world? Perhaps the moon approached this world with greater force than in prior years because you yearned so desperately for it. If the moon truly came to meet you - then perhaps we can save the world if we erase you from it. ...And if I disclose this information to the other wizards, perhaps they will press for your execution."
611,Murr,"You really like using the same words over and over again. Are you a fan of ""perhaps""?"
612,Shylock,Is that sarcasm?
613,Murr,What's sarcasm? Is that a kind of breakfast food?
614,Shylock,"I don't dislike what a stray cat you've become, but I do miss the man you used to be - the great philosopher Murr. Your ideas were the most progressive in the world, while your knowledge, the most ancient. You were so intelligent and noble that I even envied you."
615,Murr,"Hey, anyway, look up at the moon! Isn't it beautiful?"
616,Shylock,You must stop yearning for the moon.
617,Murr,"Ah, you're so beautiful...."
618,Shylock,"If you do - your shattered soul may become whole again. Oh, dear genius of the ages. Do not be taken away by the moon."
619,Murr,"Oh, my dearest, horrifying Catastrophe. Do come meet me again. I will love you for all eternity."
620,Shylock,....Fufu. I suppose my attempts at persuasion were nothing but a waste of time.
621,Murr,I like waste too!
622,Shylock,"My goodness; if nothing else, that silver tongue of yours hasn't changed. Oh loathsome Murr."
623,Murr,Ahahaha!
624,Shylock,"....I wonder what will happen, come tomorrow? What sorts of wizards will come to replace the comrades we have lost.....?"
625,Narrator,The night I arrive in this mysterious world -. I haven't a clue what is going on in the various corners of the world as I sleep in my bed.
626,Eastern Country,Sherwood Forest.
627,Narrator,(Hoot hoot)
628,Eastern merchant,"....Ugh, what a horrifying night..... What's going on..... I didn't know the < Great Catastrophe > could come so close......."
629,???,..........
630,Eastern merchant,I bet the chosen wizards slacked off on their jobs! They're all dishonest and irresponsible.... Woah.....
631,Narrator,(Rustle)
632,Eastern merchant,"Hey, Guide! Don't just stop in your tracks like that!"
633,???,This is where my job as your guide ends.
634,Eastern merchant,Wh-what are you saying!? I already paid you to take me through this forest. I need to get out of here tonight!
635,???,"Well, wizards are all dishonest and irresponsible, right?"
636,Eastern merchant,D.... Don't tell me you're a wizard too......
637,???,And what if I am?
638,Eastern merchant,"H-hey, it was just a joke. Don't abandon me in the middle of nowhere like this. I'm begging you here, Eastern wizard."
639,Shino,It's Shino.
640,Eastern merchant,"Sh-Shino! Come on, please. I'll reward you richly once we're out of here."
641,Shino,Hmph. Who's the dishonest and irresponsible one now?
642,Eastern merchant,Heheh.... My bad.
643,Shino,Follow me.
644,Narrator,(Footsteps)
645,Eastern merchant,"Phew.... ....Man, this short brat's got some attitude for his size......."
646,Shino,What? Did you just call me short? Want me to leave you to the wolves?
647,Eastern merchant,"Oh, oh no, of course not! H-hey, if you're a wizard, that means you can fly, right? Can't we just zip through the sky to the other end of the forest?"
648,Shino,Say you were me. What would you gain from carrying some miserly old man on the back of your broom?
649,Eastern merchant,...........
650,Shino,"If you want to fly that badly, it'll cost you extra."
651,Eastern merchant,Extra...... What else can you do? Can you instantly teleport us to our destination or build a palace right here?
652,Shino,Traveling through space is a form of high-class magic. The same goes for extracting natural matter to build a sophisticated structure. I can make you a cave if you want.
653,Eastern merchant,What else are you good at?
654,Shino,Hunting monsters.
655,Eastern merchant,....Monsters....?
656,Narrator,(Squeak)
657,Eastern merchant,".....hh. That scared me..... It's just a bird, huh...... H-hey...... Isn't the forest acting a little strange? Is it usually like this? It feels like..... The darkness of the forest is dazzling with energy, it's terrifying."
658,Shino,"It must be the influence of the < Great Catastrophe >. The trees are astir with life; the whole forest is brimming with delight, like a creature panting with lukewarm breath."
659,Eastern merchant,"Hey, don't scare me like that....."
660,Shino,....Did something happen during the battle with the < Great Catastrophe >....?
661,Narrator,(Rumble)
662,Shino,......!
663,Eastern merchant,Eeep.....! The ground shook.....!
664,Shino,....This isn't an earthquake. It sounds like something fell and caused the tremor.
665,Eastern merchant,What the hell is going on!? Don't tell me the world is gonna end..... Were the chosen wizards wiped out!?
666,Eastern merchant,What the hell is going on!? Don't tell me the world is gonna end..... Were the chosen wizards wiped out!?
667,Shino,That's nonsense.
668,Eastern merchant,But.....
669,Shino,"They haven't been wiped out. I know someone at the magic headquarters. If anything happened to him, I'd know right away."
670,Eastern merchant,H-how?
671,Shino,"Wizards don't make promises. Because if we break a promise, we lose our magic. But I was tricked by my irresponsible master and made a promise with a fellow apprentice. We promised that we would protect each other. ...Hold your breath."
672,Eastern merchant,......hh.
673,Shino,"I sense an ancient fog..... Head over there. Don't come near me. If a normal human breathes this stuff in, it'll put them to sleep. The stars and the darkness are throbbing with life. The < Great Catastrophe > got too close: it's bringing the forest and the atmosphere back to their primitive state....."
674,Eastern merchant,Yaaaawn...... I'm getting kinda sleepy........
675,Narrator,(Thump)
676,Shino,"......! I told you not to come near! Geez.... Dammit, you're so heavy....... ............ I hope he's not hurt...... But I bet he's ready to cry at any moment now. He's a spoiled young master, after all......"
677,Narrator,(Roar)
678,Shino,.....? What is this..... ....A beast's roar? .........! It's coming this way....... ..........!!
679,Narrator,(Roar)
680,Shino,What in the world is that......!?
681,Central Country,Capital.
682,Central Country citizen woman,Look! There's another tornado over there......!
683,Central Country citizen man,There are tornadoes howling through the streets left and right! They're tearing huge holes in the ground......!
684,Central Country citizen woman,Sigh...... I can't believe this all happened overnight...... Even the beautiful castle is in ruins.......
685,Central Country citizen man,......Ah......! The castle walls are collapsing again......! Run! You'll get crushed by the rubble!
686,Central Country child,......Mommy......!
687,???,<< Pernoctant Nixzo >> !
688,Central Country citizen man,......! The rubble stopped mid-air......!
689,???,Escape from there while you can! It's all right now.
690,Central Country child,......Ah......
691,Central Country mother,"Come here, darling!"
692,Central Country child,..........
693,Narrator,(Running footsteps)
694,Central Country citizen man,Thank goodness! Everyone managed to escape! Who is the wizard who saved us......
695,Central Country child,"Thank you, mister......"
696,???,You're welcome. Are you hurt anywhere?
697,Central Country child,Nope!
698,???,I'm glad that you're safe.
699,Central Country mother,"Please, let me thank you properly...... May I ask you for your name?"
700,???,"Oh, it was nothing......"
701,Narrator,(Footsteps)
702,Central Country troops,Prince Arthur!
703,Central Country child,Prince......?
704,Central Country mother,The Prince......!?
705,Central Country troops,"It's dangerous around here, Your Highness. Please refrain from running off on your own!"
706,Arthur,"Sorry. I'll head back right now. I'll be taking my leave, then."
707,Narrator,(Footsteps)
708,Central Country child,"Thank you, Mister Prince!"
709,Central Country mother,Thank you very much! I'll never forget your kindness!
710,Central Country troops,"Your Highness, over here!"
711,Arthur,Assess the damage! Prioritize medical treatment for the injured!
712,Central Country troops,"Yes, sir!"
713,Arthur,"Everyone, I understand that you are all undergoing great difficulties right now, but I implore you to endure just a little longer. I will protect the peace of this country!"
714,Central Country man,Long live Prince Arthur!
715,Central Country woman,"What a beautiful, kind prince......"
716,Arthur,"So we lost our Sage in the battle against the < Great Catastrophe >...... I wanted to say farewell properly, but I hope he managed to make it safely back to his world...... Was the ritual to summon the new Sage successful?"
717,Drummond,Y-Yes. But the chosen wizards snatched him away to the magic headquarters.
718,Arthur,Why?
719,Drummond,They said something about saving a dying wizard......
720,Arthur,Some of the wizards got hurt? Why didn't you report this to me?
721,Drummond,"W-Well, the Sage could always summon new wizards to replace the ones lost during the battle against the ......."
722,Arthur,"Don't talk about wizards like that: they're not weapons you can replace like bows and guns, even if they do possess magic."
723,Drummond,"With all due respect...... To us, the wizards are nothing more than troublesome weapons. Being a wizard yourself, I understand why you might favor them, but......"
724,Arthur,......You think I favor them......
725,Drummond,"Not all wizards are benevolent beings who help humans, anyway! Just look at Oz, who controlled the world under his rule of terror - he's exactly the kind of wizard I'm talking about! Humans have long suffered under the thumb of wicked wizards!"
726,Arthur,............
727,Drummond,"That's precisely why we have to win the Sage over - the Sage acts as the bridge between humans and wizards, and we must ensure that we are holding the reins. Prince Arthur, it is not the wizards' side that you should be taking, but ours, the humans! Remember that you're the prince of Central Country!"
728,Arthur,"I will not take sides. Like the Sage, I want to play my part in bringing humans and wizards together. The < Great Catastrophe > is a threat to this entire world. Humans and wizards alike have to overcome it by working together."
729,Drummond,I understand...... I'll be taking my leave then.
730,Narrator,(Footsteps)
731,Arthur,"............ Sigh...... There is still a deep gulf between humans and wizards, but I can't give up. Someday, I'm sure we can all come to understand each other. I hope the wizards at the magic headquarters and the new sage are all right......"
732,Narrator,(Footsteps)
733,Drummond,It is truly vexing how Prince Arthur insists on favoring the wizards......
734,???,Drummond.
735,Drummond,L-Lord Vincent!
736,Vincent,I believe my instructions were for you to bring the Sage to the castle at once. But it seems that you have failed to do so.
737,Drummond,M-My apologies! The wizards got in the way......
738,Vincent,"We suffered immense damage from the < Great Catastrophe > precisely because those wizards slacked on their jobs. They say that wizards will obey the Sage. Before the new wizards gather, seize the Sage and make sure he bends to our will."
739,Drummond,"B-but if we steal away the Sage, we'll just anger the wizards even further......"
740,Vincent,"There's no need to worry. As long as we control the sage, they'll have to obey us. This is all for the sake of the people of Central Country. ......He might very well be the son of my brother the King, but I won't allow Arthur to have his way any longer."
741,Narrator,"At daybreak, I wake from my dream. I was half-hoping to wake up and find myself back in my old world, but it seems like this is my current reality."
742,Akira,(This still feels unreal...... But I'm grateful that I've landed myself in the company of good people.)
743,Narrator,"I open the window, taking in the sound of birds chirping and the scent of morning dew. Somewhere in the distance, I hear the rippling of a stream. Without thinking, I inhale deeply, breathing in the fragrance of flowers carried by the wind. What a pleasant, refreshing mood to wake up to. Being surrounded by such a lush view of nature is enough to lift my spirits."
744,Akira,(How many days has it been since I last had a leisurely morning like this......) (What an endlessly blue sky. How pretty......) (......Ah......) (You can still see the huge white moon so clearly in the sky.)
745,Narrator,(Knocking)
746,Akira,Oh...... Yes!
747,Cain,"Good morning, Sir Sage."
748,Cain,"Good morning, Sir Sage."
749,Narrator,It's Cain's voice.
750,Akira,"(The twins did say that Cain was a knight of Central Country, so he should be acquainted with Prince Arthur since they're from the same country.....)"
751,Cain,Sir Sage. Are you still asleep?
752,Akira,"Ah, I'm awake! Please give me a moment. I'm not properly dressed yet......"
753,Cain,"Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I'm sure you look wonderful even if you've just woken up."
754,Akira,............ (What a devastatingly smooth line...... This guy must be really popular......)
755,Cain,But manners make the knight. I'll wait for you to get ready.
756,Akira,Th-thank you.
757,Cain,Take your time.
758,Narrator,(Rustle) (Door opens)
759,Narrator,"After I finish getting ready, I open the door. As I do, Cain's smiling face gives way to confusion."
760,Cain,Huh? Where are you?
761,Akira,Eh? I'm right here.
762,Cain,"Uh, where?"
763,Akira,In front of you......
764,Cain,"In front of me? See, you're not here."
765,Akira,"Woah, that was my arm!"
766,Cain,Eh?
767,Akira,"I'm right in front of you. See, I'm here......"
768,Narrator,"I clasp Cain's hand with both of mine. In that moment, our eyes meet."
769,Cain,"Ah, there you are. Why did you hide yourself?"
770,Akira,I didn't; I can't even use magic.
771,Cain,Is that so...... Then why couldn't I see you?
772,Akira,............
773,Narrator,"Cain thinks it over for a while, then looks back up suddenly."
774,Cain,"Well, who cares."
775,Akira,A-are you sure?
776,Cain,It might be because of this one eye. See how one of my eyeballs is red?
777,Narrator,"Cain bends down so that his gaze meets mine, and points to one eye with his finger."
778,Cain,This red one wasn't originally mine.
779,Akira,It's not yours......?
780,Cain,Yeah. A wizard with a terrible personality gouged out my eyeball and took it against my will.
781,Akira,Wha......?!?
782,Cain,And then he stuck one of his own eyes in there.
783,Akira,"S......Some people do some scary things, huh."
784,Cain,I should've been more careful. But I'm going to defeat him someday and take my eyeball back.
785,Akira,D-did it hurt?
786,Cain,"Of course it hurt. For a while it wouldn't listen to me at all, and it kept trying to look around at everything but where I was trying to look."
787,Narrator,Cain's resolute frown shifts into a grave expression.
788,Cain,It was Owen.
789,Akira,......Huh?
790,Cain,"The guy who stole my eyeball. It was Owen, a Northern wizard. Don't get too close to him. The first thing you should do if you meet Owen is look away immediately. Don't listen to anything he says. It's over once you talk to him. If you don't keep ahold of yourself, he'll drag you into the depths of darkness."
791,Akira,......I understand......
792,Narrator,"Looking at my nervous expression, Cain laughs amiably."
793,Cain,"Don't worry. I'll protect you no matter what happens. Owen doesn't really drop by anyway. Uh-oh, I forgot to address you formally. Sorry, Sir Sage. I get reprimanded for it fairly often, but I just......."
794,Akira,Oh..... You don't have to speak formally to me.
795,Cain,"Really? That'd be a great help. I'm no good with manners and etiquette. Please, think of me as your friend. Let's take a walk outside. I'll listen to your request as we walk."
796,Akira,Huh?
797,Cain,"I heard from Sir Snow and Sir White. You want to meet Prince Arthur, don't you? So that you can return to your world."
798,Narrator,"Cain smiles, a little sadly."
799,Cain,Though I personally would like you to stay in this world.
800,Narrator,"I walk alongside Cain, and look up into the sky. The huge white moon makes a faint outline against the blue skies."
801,Akira,It really is huge.......
802,Cain,What is?
803,Akira,The moon. I was just thinking that the moon in this world is so huge.
804,Cain,"Well, it did just attack us yesterday."
805,Akira,Attack......?
806,Narrator,"As Cain looks up at the moon, his eyes narrow into a glare."
807,Cain,"That's the < Great Catastrophe >. It attacks once a year, trying to destroy this world. That is the opponent that we are up against."
808,Akira,The moon.....? Are you fighting the moon......!?
809,Cain,That's right. We intercept the moon's attacks and send them back into the sky - that's our role as the Sage's wizards.
810,Narrator,Wizards who fight against the moon.......
811,Narrator,"I look up at the sky, struck speechless by that extraordinary tale. To think that every time that huge moon approaches, they have to fight against it in order to protect the world."
812,Akira,"Once a year, every year......?"
813,Cain,"Yeah, every year."
814,Akira,Has it always been like this......?
815,Cain,Always.
816,Narrator,Cain shrugs.
817,Cain,"It would be so much easier if only we could finish it off in one shot. But the same goes for most troublesome things in this world. You deal with them, then the next problem pops up...... The same thing happens again and again, and you just try to find a way to deal with it. You don't get a fairytale ending tied up neatly in a bow. You have to patiently carry on."
818,Akira,..............
819,Cain,"......That's how things had been all along, and I accepted that fact. But the < Great Catastrophe > was really strange this year."
820,Akira,"Strange, you say......"
821,Cain,"It was almost impossibly strong. It drew close with so much power that even the veteran wizards were no match for it...... There were twenty of us, but we lost half of our comrades......"
822,Narrator,"Cain falls silent, his eyes cast downwards."
823,Narrator,(Wind rustling)
824,Narrator,"In the rays of the morning sun, a breeze sweeps through the air silently."
825,Cain,"......The < Great Catastrophe > got so close. I'm sure the capital suffered significant damage too. You said you wanted to meet Prince Arthur, right? He's in Granvelle Castle in the capital. I make trips to the castle pretty regularly, so I can take you along with me. I'm sure His Highness will welcome you warmly. But could I ask you to just hang in there and wait a little longer, until we can figure out the extent of the damage to the capital and get repairs under way?"
826,Akira,(......The extent of the damage...... The moon drew close to this world. I can't even begin to imagine the sort of damage that would cause......) I understand...... I'm sorry for making such a selfish demand with everything else going on.
827,Cain,"What are you saying? We're the ones making selfish demands of you when you're in a difficult situation. I'd hoped that you would come to like us, and this world, if possible...... But I understand that nothing quite beats the home where you've always lived."
828,Akira,If there's anything I can do in the time that I'm here.......
829,Cain,Are you sure?
830,Akira,"Y-Yeah. I can clean, for example......"
831,Cain,Leave the chores to us. But we do want you to perform the summoning ritual for the new wizards.
832,Akira,The new wizards?
833,Cain,Remember how I said our numbers were down to half? There were originally twenty of the Sage's wizards. Only the sage can summon new wizards to fill in for those we lost. Can I ask you to do that?
834,Narrator,"I hesitate slightly at Cain's grave expression, then nod."
835,Akira,"If it's something I can do, I'll give it a shot."
836,Cain,"Guys, I have news! Sir Sage said he would perform the summoning ritual for the new wizards."
837,Narrator,Cain announces this in the dining room. Murr and Shylock turn their eyes towards him. But Cain tilts his head curiously.
838,Cain,Huh? Nobody's here?
839,Murr,"I'm here! Morning, Cain, Sir Sage!"
840,Cain,Murr? Where are you?
841,Murr,Inside your pocket!
842,Cain,"Stop with your silly jokes. Come on, show yourself."
843,Murr,"But I am showing myself? In fact, I don't know how much more I can reveal."
844,Cain,"Ahaha, you're being silly."
845,Akira,Cain.... I do think there's something wrong with your eyes.
846,Narrator,That's when Snow and White appear.
847,Snow,Good morning.
848,White,"Good morning, everyone."
849,Shylock,Good morning. How is Faust doi.... Ouch.
850,Cain,Shylock. Don't show up out of thin air right in front of my eyes.
851,Shylock,But you are the one who crashed into me headfirst.
852,Cain,Huh?
853,Shylock,Are you suffering from a hangover?
854,Cain,"No, it's just that my eyes have been acting up..... But now that I think about it, I can't see the twins."
855,Snow,Ohoho. It certainly seems like there are strange things happening.
856,White,"You see, we too were trapped within a painting last night."
857,Cain,"Hey, don't turn this into a joke. I'm telling the truth here. Anyway, guess what? Sir Sage said he would perform the summoning ritual for the new wizards."
858,Shylock,"That would help us out tremendously. Thank you, Sir Sage."
859,Murr,Yay! New comrades!
860,Akira,"I don't know if I can pull it off, but I hope I can be of some help to you all."
861,Snow,"We are grateful for your help, Sage. Well then, let's perform the summoning ritual a little past noon."
862,White,It's better to perform the ritual when the < Great Catastrophe > isn't visible in the sky.
863,Narrator,"Snow and White say this, gazing up at the faint white moon. Shylock looks at me and smiles."
864,Shylock,"Please take it easy until then. For now, let us enjoy some breakfast. Cain, could you go wake Heathcliff? The witches and the Southern wizards all turned to stone, so there's nobody to prepare breakfast for us all."
865,Cain,Can he even cook breakfast? I thought he was a noble young master.
866,Shylock,"He's quite skilled with his hands, remember? Can you think of anyone else who can cook?"
867,Cain,What about you? Don't you run a bar? The light meal you made for me the other day was delicious.
868,Shylock,I don't particularly feel like serving others first thing in the morning.
869,Cain,"Then I'll cook. You just have to throw everything into a pot and let it boil, right?"
870,Akira,"Ah.... If you'd like, I can make something?"
871,Akira,Ojiya!? I can make ojiya! I didn't realize I could eat ojiya in this world!
872,Cain,You sound delighted.
873,Shylock,"That reminds me - the previous sage also said that delicious meals were the key to adapting to a new environment. Well then, I'll leave it to you. Let me take you to the kitchen."
874,Narrator,I am shaken by what awaits me in the kitchen.
875,Narrator,Unfamiliar ingredients are stuffed into transparent jars and lined up on shelves.
876,Narrator,"A mysterious kind of dried seaweed, bottled up and labeled ""feels like kombu""..... White grains labeled ""feels like rice""....... A sticky, dark green substance labeled ""pretty much miso""......"
877,Akira,"The sage before me really tried his best, huh......."
878,Narrator,I roll up my sleeves and grab a pot when Heathcliff comes running into the kitchen.
879,Heathcliff,"Let me help you, Sir Sage."
880,Akira,"Ah, it's fine. Don't worry about it."
881,Heathcliff,"No, I can't have that. I'm actually pretty good at this sort of thing, so please let me assist you."
882,Narrator,"Heathcliff rolls up his sleeves and smiles at me. His beauty is honestly mesmerizing. At the same time, though, his smile is awkward: like a shy boy trying his best to be friendly. He's probably not a very outgoing person - but maybe he's trying to approach me because of everything that happened with Faust. He reminds me of Hanako from the old cat lady's place. She would first watch all the other cats clamor around me, and then cautiously approach me. I smile at him, hoping it'll help him feel at ease."
883,Akira,Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
884,Heathcliff,"Of course. Um, what are you cooking?"
885,Akira,I was going to make ojiya.
886,Heathcliff,"Oh, that's the thing kind of like porridge that the previous sage used to make for us. The soup stock is the key to its flavor, right?"
887,Narrator,"Heathcliff ties his apron and waves his slender fingers like a conductor of an orchestra. The window opens, and an egg comes flying through the air. A kettle floats into the air and tilts water into a pot; it boils the moment it hits the pot, and in goes some ""feels like kombu."" The ""feels like kombu"" releases a screech and absorbs the water, expanding to over twice its original size as it transforms into the shape of a webbed hand."
888,Akira,...What is this.....?
889,Heathcliff,It's submersive algae. It's a seaweed that clings to ships and drags them to the bottom of the ocean. I had never eaten it before either. Were you able to get a good rest last night?
890,Akira,"Ah, yes. I fell asleep while reading the sage's manual....."
891,Narrator,I answer his questions in a daze while watching the various utensils and ingredients fly about the kitchen.
892,Narrator,(Tap tap tap)
893,Narrator,"The eggs crack to a delightful rhythm and whip themselves up inside the bowl. While preparing the ojiya, Heathcliff begins to drip some coffee."
894,Akira,"Wow, being a wizard really lets you do a lot......"
895,Heathcliff,Huh?
896,Akira,"Ah, it's nothing! There was coffee back in my world too. You're not going to use magic to prepare the coffee?"
897,Heathcliff,"Ahaha. I could, but I feel like it always tastes better when I make it manually. I do make sugar with magic. It's the first kind of magic that wizard children learn and practice. It might look simple, but it can actually be pretty difficult to get the star shape and sweet flavor right. Beginners make all kinds of mistakes: sometimes it stays as powdered sugar, or it doesn't really taste like anything, or it turns into sugar water."
898,Narrator,(Water boiling)
899,Narrator,"The ""feels like rice"" reaches a boil, and Heathcliff drops the whipped eggs into the pot. They dance in perfect loops through the air as they make their gentle landing."
900,Heathcliff,"The sugar we make has health benefits; it's known to reduce both physical and mental fatigue. That's why humans purchase sugar from us. Sir Sage, could you hold out your hand?"
901,Narrator,"I do as I'm told, offering Heathcliff my outstretched palm. He points to it with his index finger."
902,Narrator,"And a few beautiful, star-shaped sugars tumble onto my palm."
903,Akira,Woah.... That's amazing!
904,Narrator,Heathcliff smiles bashfully in response.
905,Heathcliff,"It's no big deal, really - any wizard can do this."
906,Narrator,"I try to pinch the sugar with my fingertips, but it quickly dissolves into a fine powder. The delicacy reminds me of him."
907,Akira,"(So this is what it's like to live in a world with magic.....) Um.... How does one become a wizard? If I memorize the spell that you used yesterday, will I be able to use magic too?"
908,Narrator,"If I could use magic, I'd like to try - that's what's going through my mind when I ask Heath my question. He looks like he doesn't really know how to answer me."
909,Heathcliff,"Um..... You don't really get to choose whether or not you're a wizard. Wizards are born from humans at random. And the children of wizards aren't necessarily wizards either. It's like a sudden mutation of sorts. It's said that about one in ten thousand are born as wizards, and it looks like that number has been dwindling as of late. But wizards are also long-lived. The previous sage said it's not a job change, but more like a mutant hero."
910,Akira,I see.... So it's not like anyone who mutters a spell can use magic.
911,Heathcliff,"Yes.... Spells are like charms that reinforce the heart in which magic power lies. That's why every wizard has a different spell. As you repeat your favorite words over and over again, they come to harbor mysterious powers - that's what I learned."
912,Akira,"So your favorite words become your spell? Heathcliff, what does your spell mean?"
913,Heathcliff,...........
914,Narrator,"Heathcliff blinks, and purses his lip in surprise. He shyly lowers his gaze and mumbles, with bright red cheeks:"
915,Heathcliff,".....Dusk, and the sound of rain......"
916,Akira,Dusk and the sound of rain......
917,Heathcliff,Do you think it's weird.....?
918,Akira,Not at all. I love both dusk and the sound of rain.
919,Narrator,"Heathcliff smiles, relieved. Though still bashful, he seems to have opened up a little as we continue cooking."
920,Heathcliff,"I apologize. No one's ever really asked me that question, so I got a little nervous....."
921,Akira,"Oh no, I'm sorry - was it rude of me to ask?"
922,Heathcliff,"No; I just thought it might sound a bit childish. Especially because some wizards have spells that mean things like ""true love"" and ""the truth of the universe."""
923,Akira,"That sounds cool too. But I think my spell would be something like the title of my favorite song, or the name of a cat."
924,Heathcliff,You like cats?
925,Akira,Yes. I love them.
926,Heathcliff,"Mr. Faust loves cats too. He tries to keep it a secret, but I've seen him covertly playing with them a number of times."
927,Akira,"Really? I think we'll get along, then."
928,Heathcliff,"He might seem scary, but he's a very good teacher."
929,Narrator,"Before I knew it, Heathcliff was making eye contact and smiling as we spoke."
930,Heathcliff,"According to Mr. Faust, ""Just as humans fasten their bodies to objects to use them, wizards fasten their hearts to nature to harness it."""
931,Akira,Fasten their hearts to nature.....
932,Heathcliff,"Yes. The clearer the vision in your mind, the more powerful your magic, and the more likely your spell is to succeed."
933,Akira,"The vision in your mind... So if you have great power, does that mean you can do anything at all?"
934,Heathcliff,"What a wizard can do with magic varies depending on the wizard's magical power, as well as his specialties and weak points. There are certain things we can't do, such as reviving the dead, or turning back time.... We can't create something out of nothing."
935,Akira,"I see. But Heathcliff, it looked like you stopped time yesterday when you used your watch against the soldiers."
936,Heathcliff,"Oh no, I didn't! I just imagined time had stopped in order to freeze their movements."
937,Narrator,"Heathcliff laughs, his brows turned down."
938,Heathcliff,"It would be nice if we could turn back time, though. I'm always so indecisive, so there are lots of things I'd like to redo."
939,Narrator,I feel the same. His ordinary commentary makes me feel closer to him.
940,Akira,"(Magic can be surprising and all, but it looks like wizards can harbor the same feelings as humans.)"
941,Heathcliff,"....All right, done. I'll take this out to the dining room."
942,Akira,"Yes, please. Thank you."
943,Murr,"Ya~y, breakfast time!"
944,Shylock,"Murr, no flying during mealtime. Sit down when you eat your food."
945,Snow,Oh. I've had this before. It's sojiya.
946,White,You must mean mojiya.
947,Cain,It's ojiya. I'm going to add the sal....
948,Narrator,(Bump)
949,Bradley,Ouch! What do you think you're doing!
950,Cain,Bradley.... When did you get here?
951,Bradley,I've been here the entire time! Did you leave your eyes at home!?
952,Heathcliff,"You couldn't see me earlier either. Are you sure you're all right, Cain....?"
953,Cain,"This is getting to be a real problem.... But let's eat for now, before the food gets cold."
954,Shylock,"You know, it's always bothered me how this meal called ojiya doesn't go well with coffee."
955,Narrator,"As I spend time with them, I come to learn more about each of their personalities, bit by bit. Murr is whimsical and impulsive. Shylock is mature, but he does everything at his own pace. Cain is friendly, like an older brother. Heathcliff is shy. I don't know much about Bradley, but he's quick to lose his temper. And everyone seems to respect Snow and White. It reminds me of all the cats who lived in the old cat lady's yard. Each one lived life as it pleased. And you couldn't really tell if they got along, or hated each other. - Watching these wizards reminds me of that carefree lifestyle. As does listening to their very lively conversation."
956,Snow,That's right. We need to explain the < Great Catastrophe > to the Sage.
957,Cain,"Oh, I discussed it with him earlier."
958,White,"Oh, is that so? Excellent; it saves us the effort."
959,Snow,"If you'd like to learn more, you should ask Murr. He once researched the < Great Catastrophe >, you see."
960,Shylock,"The current Murr wouldn't be able to explain anything to you. He got too close to the secret behind it all, and it completely shattered his soul."
961,Akira,Shattered his soul.... Does that sort of thing happen often?
962,Shylock,"It's certainly not common. But I could certainly say the same for exchanging eyeballs, or tying a ghost to this world using magic."
963,Bradley,Hah. What a bunch of weirdos.
964,Shylock,I'm quite fond of you all. Be it wine or humans - bizarre abnormalities carry stories that are just as rich as those of outstanding excellencies.
965,Cain,You really are a Western wizard.
966,Shylock,And you are very much like a Central wizard - you're honest to your very core.
967,Akira,"Um.... when you say ""like a Central wizard"" or ""Western wizard,"" what does that all mean?"
968,Snow,"There are five countries in this world: Central, North, West, East, and South."
969,White,A wizard's disposition varies depending on the country they reside in. The previous sage recorded it in the sage's manual.
970,Akira,The sage's manual.....
971,Narrator,"Once I finish eating, I open up the sage's manual, which I brought from my room."
972,Narrator,(Flips)
973,Narrator,"""It looks like four wizards from each of the five countries - Central Country, Eastern Country, Western Country, Southern Country, and Northern Country - are chosen as the Sage's wizards."" ""Some supernatural power chooses them, so the sage gets no say in who arrives. Which means I can't summon my own army of pretty witches. Pretty disappointing."" ""The wizards of each region share certain character traits."" ""Even if a wizard is born in one place, it may not necessarily be the land they're associated with; if they have lived in a country for long enough, they can grow accustomed to the traits of that land. So there are Eastern wizards who were born in the West."" ""Central wizards have strong hearts of justice. They care deeply about those close to them, and take on jobs that nobody else wants to do. Suited for leadership roles."""
974,Akira,(Central wizards.... So Cain and Oz. I can definitely see how Cain is a Central wizard.)
975,Narrator,"""Eastern wizards are usually total misanthropes. They're closed off, fundamentally serious, and like being left alone. They're cute when they become fond of you. But if you piss them off, they'll hold a grudge for the rest of their lives."""
976,Akira,(Eastern wizards.... So Heathcliff and Faust.)
977,Narrator,"""Western wizards are temperamental and whimsical. You can't hold a normal conversation with them. They live in their own worlds, and they really love festivals. Lots of weirdos here."""
978,Akira,(Western wizards.... So Murr and Shylock.)
979,Narrator,"""Southern wizards are kind and generous. You feel relaxed and at ease around them. They like helping others. But since they're quick to protect those in danger even though their magical powers aren't very strong, I'm always worried about them....."""
980,Akira,"(Southern wizards..... Huh, I haven't met any......) (I want to meet a Southern wizard.... Someone who's kind and makes you feel at ease.....)"
981,Narrator,"""Northern wizards are scary. They're extremely powerful. And they all hate each other. Totally self-centered. These guys would survive even a complete apocalypse."""
982,Narrator,"""I'm pretty sure they will all be here when the next sage arrives, so let me describe each of them in detail."" ""Snow and White. They're relatively peaceful and fairly cooperative. They love to joke around. They're the oldest wizards here - apparently they've lived for several thousands of years."""
983,Akira,(Snow and White.... They've lived for even longer than I imagined.)
984,"""Bradley. Warning","handle with caution. He used to be the boss of a crime group. Currently a prisoner. Terrifying when mad, but you can sort of appease him with food."""
985,Akira,"(Huh. Now that I think about it, he was eating a lot of ojiya.....)"
986,"""Owen. Warning","handle with caution. Creepy. Talking with him makes you feel like you're having a mental breakdown. Just make sure he never takes an interest in you and you should be all right."""
987,Akira,(He's the one Cain was talking about.... He sounds scary......)
988,"""Mithra. Maximum warning","handle with extra caution. Don't be fooled by his looks and his polite speech. He's a beast. He'll kill you."""
989,Akira,(A beast..... He'll kill you....... I really don't want to meet him now.....) (Huh....? There's one more....?)
990,Narrator,"""Oz. He's a Northern wizard who was summoned as a Central wizard for some reason. He's infamous for taking over the world with his magical powers."""
991,Akira,"(.....He took over the world.....?) (So he was an infamous dictator....? He looked scary, but I don't really think he was that bad a person.)"
992,Shylock,What are you doing?
993,Narrator,"Shylock takes a seat next to me as I read the sage's manual. On the table, he places a steaming bottle of wine, leaves of various shapes, small berries, and rose petals."
994,Akira,Ah.... There was still some time till noon - when we wanted to do the ceremony - so I was reading the sage's manual.
995,Shylock,You looked completely engrossed. Was it that interesting?
996,Akira,"Yes. It contains stories about this world, and the wizards living in it..... Everything is so fascinating...."
997,Shylock,I'm glad to hear it.
998,Narrator,"Shylock smiles as he pulls apart the leaves, berries, and petals, placing them into the wine bottle. When the wine looks like it's about to overflow from the bottle, he pours it into a cup and drinks it. And then goes back to adding leaves to the bottle. He looks like he's enjoying himself."
999,Akira,"What are you doing, Shylock?"
1000,Shylock,"I'm making herbal wine. I run a bar in Western Country, after all."
1001,Akira,"You're supposed to save the world, but you also work at a bar?"
1002,Narrator,"Shylock stuffs another petal into the jar as he smiles, his eyes twinkling."
1003,Shylock,"Saving the world doesn't put food on the table, after all. Though failing to save the world would also mean there would be no food on the table."
1004,Akira,I-I see. That sounds like hard work.
1005,Shylock,"No, I quite enjoy it. I love this job, you see. It can bring about many troubles, but making the time to enjoy yourself leads to a richer and more fulfilling lifestyle."
1006,Narrator,"Shylock's words lighten up my heart. Now that I think about it - I came to such a strange new world, but I haven't yet managed to fully enjoy the opportunity. It would be nice if I could enjoy this world to its fullest before I return home."
1007,Akira,Um... Would it be rude for me to ask a wizard to show me some magic?
1008,Shylock,"That all depends on the time, the place, and the person. If you were to ask me right now, I wouldn't find it particularly rude. If you begged me, ""Please show me magic,"" I would in fact quite like it; it would feel like a naughty game. I would be tempted to act all bashful and reply, ""Just for you, then."""
1009,Narrator,"He gazes at me with alluring eyes, and for some reason, my cheeks turn bright red."
1010,Akira,I..... I see.......
1011,Narrator,(Snap)
1012,Narrator,"The wine bottle begins to boil at the snap of Shylock's fingers. The leaves, the rosebuds, and the berries all dance within the bottle as it spits out a white steam."
1013,Akira,Wow.....
1014,Shylock,"I like to provide service by nature, so I couldn't stop myself from putting on a little show without you having to beg. But I'll be looking forward to an adorable ""pretty-please"" next time."
1015,Narrator,Shylock smiles delightfully while casting me a seductive gaze.
1016,Shylock,"Wizards use magic with our hearts. That's why we adore love. At the same time, we're terrified of love, and we even loathe it. Yet wizards will fall in love with anything: be it men, women, animals, or stars. There are wizards who fall in love with the breeze and follow it around the world; there are wizards who fear flowers, and try to envelop the whole world in darkness. Sometimes, that becomes their entire life - from beginning to end. It might sound foolish, but I beg of you: do not laugh at us, Sir Sage. We are simply accepting our own dispositions with great earnestness, embracing and enjoying the day to day that our natures bring about as we march forward on our quests for happiness."
1017,Narrator,"The steam from the wine bottle begins to dissipate, and Shylock clears the table and stands up."
1018,Shylock,I apologize for disturbing you. Please enjoy the rest of your book.
1019,Akira,Ah.... No.... Do talk to me about wizards again. Your stories were fascinating. I love learning about wizards.
1020,Narrator,Shylock blinks and smiles happily.
1021,Shylock,Of course. I would love to.
1022,Narrator,"When the clock strikes noon, the wizards begin to gather. Snow and White are the first ones at the scene. It's time for the summoning ritual."
1023,Snow,We'll explain the steps as you go through them. It'll be OJT.
1024,Akira,OJT.....?
1025,White,"We learned this phrase from the previous sage. OJT stands for ""On-the-Job Training"",you learn through example."
1026,Snow,Classroom learning is called a lecture.
1027,White,A discussion is called a meeting.
1028,Snow,The mediator is called a trainer. Though we call them teachers.
1029,Akira,"I see.... Um, can I ask one question in advance? Is this going to hurt? Or will it be scary.....?"
1030,Narrator,Shylock and Murr look at each other.
1031,Shylock,It didn't seem particularly painful or frightening to us?
1032,Murr,"Oh, but the previous sage might've cried?"
1033,Narrator,I flinch and take a step backwards.
1034,Akira,P-please wait a moment. Can I read the sage's manual before we go on? I want to know what to expect before I head into this ritual......
1035,Cain,Of course. I hope he wrote something about the ritual.
1036,Narrator,"I flip through the pages in a hurry, searching for text related to the summoning ritual."
1037,Narrator,(Flip)
1038,Akira,...Found it!
1039,Narrator,"""On summoning new wizards"" ""When a wizard's magical powers wane and their crest disappears, they retire from being a Sage's wizard. That's when the sage summons a new wizard to take their place."" ""Also, when wizards turn to stone during a battle with the < Great Catastrophe >, the sage summons the same number of wizards to replace them. But this rarely happens."" ""Please see the following for details regarding the summoning process."" ""You place a mana stone into the goblet of something (I forget the name), drink the pitch-black liquid that emerges, and lift the goblet to the sky."" ""The black liquid smells like blood, and tastes like the worst mixture of honey, raw fish, herbs, and cheese that you could possibly imagine."" ""I cried drinking it."""
1040,Akira,".....Gulp, ah......"
1041,Snow,Well done.
1042,White,"Well done, Sage."
1043,Akira,I... I drank it..... Ughhh..........
1044,Bradley,"......Damn, he really drank it all......"
1045,Cain,"Great job, Akira!"
1046,Heathcliff,I'll serve you some delicious coffee later!
1047,Murr,"See, you did cry!"
1048,Shylock,I believe I too would break down in tears.
1049,Snow,"Sage. Lift the ""Goblet of Judgment"" above your head."
1050,White,You mustn't let go of the goblet no matter what.
1051,Narrator,"Blinking back tears, I lift the goblet above my head with both arms. In that moment, a strange feeling runs through my body. It feels as if I've become a goblet in order to fulfill something yet to come......."
1052,Akira,......!
1053,Narrator,An exhilarating impulse bubbles up from the depths of my body like a dragon soaring into the skies.
1054,Narrator,(Woosh)
1055,Narrator,It transforms into an actual gust of wind that whirls around me. The ceiling of the hall turns pitch black.
1056,Akira,(......So this is the summoning ritual....!)
1057,Narrator,(Rustle)
1058,Heathcliff,......The wind is so strong...... I wonder if Sir Sage is all right......
1059,Snow,Do not worry. The summoning ritual is proceeding smoothly.
1060,White,"Right now, the Sage is becoming one with the ""Goblet of Judgment."""
1061,Snow & White,So that he may bestow crests upon the newly chosen wizards.
1062,Narrator,"I feel like I can hear Snow and White's voices in the distance, but I can't see them. Forests, rainbow-filled skies, thunderstorms over erupting volcanoes - a cacophony of scenery changes rapidly in front of my eyes. I cling to the goblet, attacked by the sensation of hurtling through different ages and landscapes. ""Don't let go no matter what."" I recall Snow's warning, and tighten my grip."
1063,Narrator,"......Before I know it, I'm awash in a sea of golden light. I feel like I'm standing on the moon."
1064,Akira,............!
1065,Narrator,"Words unknown to myself tumble out of my mouth. They ripple through the golden world around me, like water overflowing from a filled goblet. And then the golden world vanishes, as if someone drank it all up."
1066,Akira,......Huh......
1067,Snow,"You did splendidly, Sage."
1068,White,"Well done. Ten rays of light shot out from the ""Goblet of Judgment"" and into the world."
1069,Akira,D-does that mean the ritual was a success?
1070,Snow & White,"Yes, yes."
1071,Akira,Woah......
1072,Narrator,"I duck down as Snow and White pat my head. Suddenly, I become keenly aware of the heavy weight of the goblet in my hand. Shylock takes it from me, smiling."
1073,Shylock,"You did an excellent job. Under the guidance of the light, crests should appear on the bodies of the newly chosen wizards."
1074,Akira,Crests......
1075,Narrator,Shylock continues to smile as he eases his collar open and loosely pulls it aside.
1076,Narrator,"Offering me a furtive glance at his chest. There, on the expanse of smooth skin near the swell of the left side of Shylock's chest, is a design that looks like a tattoo of a lily."
1077,Shylock,This is the crest.
1078,Narrator,"I grow strangely flustered, both from the act of peeking down someone's collar and under the force of Shylock's sensuality."
1079,Akira,Ah...... Th-thanks......
1080,Shylock,"My, my. Why is your face all red?"
1081,Narrator,Shylock chuckles amusedly.
1082,Shylock,How adorable.
1083,Shylock,The crest appears in a different place for each person. The wizards who manifest crests on their bodies will probably make their way here from the towers in each country.
1084,Akira,"Are they coming on their own? Um, won't there be people who pretend not to notice?"
1085,Cain,"Unless the Sage's wizards are gathered, the world will be destroyed. They'll show up unless they wish for self-destruction."
1086,Snow,"Even if there are people like that, they'd get tracked down anyway under the enmity of every wizard in the world."
1087,White,There's no point to such futile resistance.
1088,Akira,I see how it is...... (The new wizards......) (I wonder what kinds of people will show up.)
1089,Eastern Country,Capital.
1090,Eastern Country man,"......Sigh...... Things are a mess everywhere you go thanks to the < Great Catastrophe >...... Hey, Owner. I'll have the usual."
1091,Nero,Here you go.
1092,Eastern Country man,"Geez, what a horrible commotion...... And it's all thanks to those damn wizards. They must've slacked off on their jobs."
1093,Nero,Ahaha. I wonder.
1094,Eastern Country man,Have you ever met a wizard?
1095,Nero,Ah...... I guess I have.
1096,Eastern Country man,"Wizards are all such sly, lazy bastards. They have incredible powers, but they won't lift a finger for us......"
1097,Nero,"Well, I guess it's like.... You know how no one wants to work for free."
1098,Eastern Country man,But they can use magic! They already have it easier than us average humans. What more do they want?
1099,Nero,"Haha...... Gratitude, maybe?"
1100,Eastern Country man,"Hmph, how ridiculous......"
1101,Nero,"Maybe they just want.... The sorts of things you take for granted, like appreciation or compassion. I mean, you say ""I'm digging in,"" or ""The meal was great,"" or ""Thank you"" whenever you eat my cooking."
1102,Eastern Country man,"Of course. You're a good, hardworking young man, and everything on your menu is delicious."
1103,Nero,Haha. Thanks. ......hh.......
1104,Eastern Country man,"What's wrong!? Hey, is your arm all right!?"
1105,Nero,......What's going on.......
1106,Eastern Country man,H-hey......! Your arm is glowing......!
1107,Nero,............!? Don't tell me...... This crest is...... ......You've gotta be kidding me.......!?
1108,Central Country,Church of Eschatology Headquarters.
1109,Riquet,......It seems like the outside world is in considerable upheaval.
1110,Priest,"Last night was the moment of Judgment that befalls us once every year. It seems that the ignorant wizards and humans have failed to protect this world. Listen to me, Revered Riquet, disciple of God. The world has sunken to such a state because of the sheer size of the foolish masses who have strayed from the righteous path. Wizards are neither the chosen ones, nor are they special. They are simply sent by God to serve His chosen humans."
1111,Riquet,"I understand, Father Priest. As a wizard...... No, as a disciple, my powers exist only to serve you and this church. For the sake of everyone here who exposed themselves to this degenerate world on my behalf and allowed me to live...... I will guide you all towards the righteous world with my power."
1112,Priest,"Now that's our Revered Riquet. Everyone, let us offer up our prayers!"
1113,Church woman,"Show us the light, Revered Riquet!"
1114,Church man,Guide us through the darkness!
1115,Church woman,"Devote yourself to our service, and guide us on our path forward!"
1116,Riquet,Thank you. ......ugh......
1117,Church man,"What's wrong, Revered Riquet?"
1118,Riquet,......My forehead is burning up...... Ah...... My head is on fire.......!
1119,Church woman,There's a light coming from his forehead!
1120,Church man,Look! What's that crest......!?
1121,Riquet,"......Crest? Uu..... ......What crest......? Please stop this pain, Father Priest......"
1122,Priest,.....What's this mark......? I've seen it before...... Riquet! What have you done!?
1123,Riquet,"I don't know...... Help me, Father Priest...... You've always taught me everything! ......What is this light? What crest are you talking about?"
1124,Church woman,Revered Riquet!
1125,Church man,Revered Riquet!
1126,Western Country,Town near the border.
1127,Chloe,"Rustica. Okay, Rustica. Here's the plan-."
1128,Rustica,Got it.
1129,Chloe,Can you agree after you listen to me!?
1130,Rustica,"You're fussy about doing things in order, Chloe."
1131,Chloe,"Let's spend the night in this town. It looks like the damage from the < Great Catastrophe > isn't too bad here. But everyone is on edge from the attack, so let's keep it a secret that we're wizards."
1132,Rustica,I'm not really keen on telling lies.
1133,Chloe,"But you said ""got it""!"
1134,Rustica,Sorry. I got things out of order.
1135,Chloe,"It's not like we're actively lying! We're just keeping quiet, that's all. Also, try not to do ""that thing"" while we're here."
1136,Rustica,"What do you mean by ""that thing""?"
1137,Chloe,"It's the whole reason you're on this journey, Rustica."
1138,Rustica,"Ah, the journey in search of my missing bride. I'm afraid I can't agree to that proposal, Chloe. If I find my bride, I simply have to talk to her. And this time, we'll hold a magnificent wedding for real. I'll pledge my eternal love to her."
1139,Chloe,"I understand how you feel, Rustica. I also want to see your precious wish fulfilled. But...... How should I put it...... Aren't you kind of careless when it comes to searching for your bride......?"
1140,Rustica,No way. I'm more faithful than any saint.
1141,Chloe,"I get that you're extremely serious about it. I really get it, but...... It's a peculiar affair, or should I say, it's hard to understand......"
1142,Western baker,"Fresh bread, straight from the oven~! My wheat storage bags burst, so bread's going for cheap today~!"
1143,Rustica,......What a divine smell...... Only my bride could bake such delicious bread......
1144,Chloe,Rustica!
1145,Rustica,"I've come for you, my bride."
1146,Western baker,Huh!? Wha......!
1147,Narrator,(Chirping)
1148,Western Country woman,"Ahhhhhhhh! The baker turned into a bird, and got sucked into that nobleman's birdcage!"
1149,Western Country man,Wizards! There are wizards in this town!
1150,Chloe,"Aaagh, right after I said all that! That guy's just some random uncle!"
1151,Rustica,"We finally meet again, my darling little bird. I won't let you go this time. I love you."
1152,Chloe,"Stop it, Rustica....! ......Give me the birdcage.....!"
1153,Rustica,Ah.....!
1154,Western baker,.....Aaagh..... Th-that was a shock! What's with this guy!?
1155,Rustica,My bride....!
1156,Chloe,He's obviously not!
1157,Western Country woman,Those guys are wizards.....
1158,Western Country man,Those wizards turned a man into a bird and captured him!
1159,Chloe,"....Th-this is looking bad.... Let's go, Rustica."
1160,Rustica,But you said we'd stay the night here?
1161,Chloe,We're changing plans! Got it?
1162,Rustica,"Got it. Oh, look. I ended up saying ""got it"" after all."
1163,Chloe,"God, Rustica, I can never win with you. .....Let's go!"
1164,Rustica,All right.
1165,Western Country woman,They're flying....!
1166,Western Country woman,Wizards! Wizards came to kidnap us!
1167,Western Country man,Someone might've been whisked away! Make sure your children are all safe!
1168,Chloe,Sigh.... I guess we're stuck camping for another night.
1169,Rustica,"How unfortunate; it seemed like a nice town, too. I thought I was going to love it. I should've fixed their broken wall."
1170,Chloe,"Even if we end up loving a town, it doesn't mean the town will love us back."
1171,Rustica,"I like camping, too. The campfire is always warm and pretty, and the stars in the sky are such a sight to behold. I can have fun anywhere long as you're there with me, Chloe."
1172,Chloe,Rustica...... Thanks. I feel the same - even though you're a master who really struggles with everyday tasks. ......hh.... Uugh.....!
1173,Rustica,"Chloe? Chloe, what's wrong?"
1174,Chloe,Wh-what is this..... ....hh....It's like my heart's on fire.........
1175,Rustica,Are you okay? Let's make a landing somewhere. Hop onto my broomstick-..... ......! ....gh..... My throat........
1176,Chloe,"Rustica.....! Rustica, your neck is shining.....!"
1177,Rustica,"......So is your chest, Chloe...... .....I-is this.... A new fashion you came up with?"
1178,Chloe,"Of course not! .....Wh-what is this.... Rustica, do you have any clue!?"
1179,Rustica,......Th-this crest..... I remember now..... We...... We were chosen by the moon.
1180,Southern Country,Village school.
1181,Southern Country child,Mr. Rutile~. We finished cleaning~!
1182,Rutile,"Ye~s. Wow, it's so clean. Well done, everyone! We can't go home until they finish repairs in the village, but let's all work together to get through this. I'm sure it won't be long."
1183,Southern Country child,Ye~s!
1184,Rutile,All right. You're all free to do what you want till dinnertime!
1185,Narrator,(Door opens)
1186,Southern Country woman,Mr. Rutile. I'd like to boil some water - could you make a flame with magic?
1187,Rutile,"Of course. Should I head over to the fireplace, or would you just like some embers?"
1188,Southern Country woman,"I think I'll take some embers, then. Let's see, could you put them in this pot?"
1189,Rutile,Of course. << Ortonik Setomaouge >>!
1190,Southern Country woman,Oh!
1191,Rutile,There we go!
1192,Southern Country woman,"Ah, thank goodness. I can prepare the pot now! It's really wonderful to have wizards around during times like these. You even lent us the school as an evacuation site.... The whole village is grateful for your help."
1193,Rutile,"Oh, it's nothing. I'm really grateful for all your delicious meals, too. It was truly a horrible disaster, but in Southern Country, wizards and humans work together.... So I'm sure everything will return to normal soon enough."
1194,Southern Country woman,I agree!
1195,Narrator,(Door opens)
1196,Mitile,Nii-sama.
1197,Mitile,Nii-sama.
1198,Rutile,Mitile.
1199,Southern Country woman,"Oh, Mitile. Hello. Mr. Rutile just gave me embers to start a fire."
1200,Mitile,Hello. Do you need help with anything? I can offer a hand.
1201,Southern Country woman,"Oh, it's all right. Well then, Mr. Rutile, I'll be going now."
1202,Rutile,Yes. See you later.
1203,Narrator,(Door closes)
1204,Mitile,Nii-sama. Dr. Figaro said he'd stop by the school once he closes his clinic for the day. He said he wanted to talk to us about the crests that appeared on our bodies this afternoon.
1205,Rutile,I see..... So these probably are the marks of the chosen wizards.
1206,Mitile,"Wizards chosen to fight against the < Great Catastrophe >, right? ....Yay! I was chosen!"
1207,Rutile,"It's a difficult role, Mitile. Why are you so happy?"
1208,Mitile,"It's an incredible role! It means the wizards from other regions won't make fun of us anymore! I won't let anyone call us Southern wizards ""soft, slow, and weak"" anymore!"
1209,Rutile,"Goodness, Mitile. You're so competitive. If you take on a role for a reason like that, you won't be able to follow your heart when you want to be soft or weak."
1210,Mitile,Follow my heart....?
1211,Rutile,"That's right. The source of a wizard's power is their heart. You simply need to follow your heart and do what you truly wish to do - do what you believe is right. No matter who makes fun of you, and no matter who you lose to - I will always love you, Mitile."
1212,Mitile,"...I love you too, nii-sama. But that's exactly why I don't want anyone to make fun of you. Nii-sama, you used to have just as much power as the Northern wizards! Because our mother is....."
1213,Rutile,The great witch Tiretta. Let's live our lives to the fullest so that she can feel proud in heaven.
1214,Mitile,Yes.....
1215,Narrator,(Door opens)
1216,Figaro,"Hey, thanks for waiting."
1217,Rutile,Dr. Figaro. Are you done with work for the day?
1218,Figaro,"Yeah. A lot of folks were injured, so it's been busy since this morning, but I managed to treat everyone."
1219,Mitile,"Dr. Figaro! You're going to tell us about these crests, right?"
1220,Figaro,"Before I do, I'm going to introduce you to another wizard with the same crest. He's someone you know well. He stopped by the clinic earlier.... Leno. Lennox, come on in."
1221,Lennox,............
1222,Rutile,"Mister Lennox! It's Mister Lennox, the shepherd!"
1223,Lennox,Hello.
1224,Mitile,It's been a while! Is the little lamb that I hugged all grown up now?
1225,Lennox,Yes. He's growing up big and strong.
1226,Rutile,"Mister Lennox, is there a crest on your body as well....?"
1227,Lennox,....Right here.
1228,Mitile,You're right.... It's the same lily crest.....
1229,Rutile,So if there are four wizards with new crests.......
1230,Figaro,It means that none of the Southern wizards who left to fight the < Great Catastrophe > will be coming home......
1231,Mitile,......Ah......
1232,Rutile,....I can't believe it.... They were all such kind people......
1233,Lennox,...............
1234,Mitile,Dr. Figaro..... Does that mean the same thing might happen to us....?
1235,Figaro,"Don't worry, Mitile. You two are the sons of the great witch Tiretta. Plus, he might be a shepherd now, but Lennox is an experienced soldier."
1236,Rutile,Huh!
1237,Mitile,"Wait, really!?"
1238,Lennox,.....I'm not really that experienced........ I've simply wandered the world for many years. That's all.
1239,Mitile,That's kind of cool......
1240,Rutile,I didn't realize you were such an amazing person....
1241,Lennox,............
1242,Figaro,See? Feeling a bit better now?
1243,Mitile,"What about you, Dr. Figaro? Is there anything cool about you?"
1244,Rutile,"Hey. Don't be rude, Mitile."
1245,Mitile,I have to know! The wizards from other countries are going to laugh at us - especially the Northern wizards. They're extra mean.
1246,Figaro,But don't you think Dr. Figaro is cool as he is? My shot-administering techniques have won the whole town over.
1247,Rutile,"Your shots hurt, Doctor."
1248,Lennox,....Dr. Figaro. Have you not told the two of them?
1249,Figaro,Shh. Stay quiet about that for now.
1250,Rutile,What is it?
1251,Lennox,Ah..... It's nothing.........
1252,Mitile,"Ahh, geez, there you go keeping secrets again! You know, Dr. Figaro said he'd stop drinking the other day, but I found a stash of alcohol tucked away in his cabinet!"
1253,Figaro,"Sorry, sorry. Keeping secrets just happens to be my hobby."
1254,Rutile,"That's not a very good hobby, you know?"
1255,Figaro,"Forgive me, Rutile. That's just how I am. In any case, we're going to head to the Southern tower tonight, so start packing now."
1256,Lennox,Will do.
1257,Rutile,I wonder if everyone in the village will be okay......
1258,Figaro,Let's do everything we can before we head on out. The < Great Catastrophe > is shaping up to be a real monster this year. I don't know when we'll be able to return.
1259,Rutile,Yes.... I understand. I hope that no more terrible things will happen.....
1260,Narrator,The summoning ritual is over; it's nighttime now.
1261,Akira,"(I wonder when the new wizards will arrive.....) (It must be rough. They were all living their own lives up till today, and now they suddenly have to take on this tremendous role.....) (I guess the same goes for me, but.....)"
1262,Narrator,(Knock knock)
1263,Heathcliff,"May I speak to you for a moment, Sir Sage?"
1264,Akira,"Ah, I'm sorry. I'm already in my pajamas, so could you give me some time to change?"
1265,Heathcliff,Ah.... Excuse me. Of course; I'll be waiting right here.
1266,Narrator,"I put on a jacket and look for a scarf to keep me warm. But the only thing I can find is a flashy shawl that seems to be made of bird feathers, so I sigh and wrap it around my neck."
1267,Akira,Thank you for waiting.
1268,Narrator,(Door opens)
1269,Heathcliff,Sir Sage.... .....Ah-choo!
1270,Akira,S-sorry about the feathers.....
1271,Heathcliff,"No no, it's fine. Are you headed out to a ball?"
1272,Akira,"This does look pretty flashy, doesn't it?"
1273,Heathcliff,I think it suits you very well. But we may not have time to dance tonight. Sir Sage. Murr found a strange man sneaking around the magic headquarters.
1274,Cock Robin,P-please wait! I'm not suspicious! Please don't kill me.....!
1275,Akira,(Ah.... He's the person who was with the bearded guy I met when I first arrived in this world.....)
1276,Murr,He was wandering around looking for the entrance to the magic headquarters!
1277,Cain,We keep the entrance hidden with magic. Those who are officially welcome would be permitted to pass through.
1278,Shylock,And why were you sneaking around the magic headquarters? What business do you have? Which organization do you belong to?
1279,Akira,"Please wait! I think he was with the old bearded man! If I'm remembering correctly - he's Cock Robin, the secretary of Central Country."
1280,Cock Robin,Yes! That's right!
1281,Shylock,Now that you mention it.....
1282,Cain,I do feel like I've met him before.
1283,Murr,I'm quick to forget things that don't interest me.
1284,Heathcliff,So what is the secretary of Central Country doing here?
1285,Cock Robin,"Ah, I guess I was taking a walk......."
1286,Shylock,A word of advice: lies will get you nowhere with wizards.
1287,Cock Robin,"I'm sorry.... Sir Drummond ordered me to lure the sage out from the magic headquarters! He said, ""So long as we have the sage, we can take over the magic headquarters using military force, and make the wizards listen to our commands!"""
1288,Cain,What did you just say!?
1289,Cock Robin,I-it wasn't my idea! Those were just my orders! I didn't want to come near the magic headquarters either! You wizards could kill me! Plus.....
1290,Narrator,Cock Robin looks down; he sounds like he's about to cry.
1291,Cock Robin,"I don't actually want to do this to you all, after everything you've done. You fought against the < Great Catastrophe > for us. But I also understand where the minister is coming from. Wizards possess great power, but we cannot control them....."
1292,Heathcliff,.....Why must we be controlled?
1293,Narrator,Heathcliff's eyes reflect disgust and a tinge of sadness.
1294,Cock Robin,Th-that's.... In order to save the world......
1295,Heathcliff,But we fought to save the world!
1296,Narrator,Shylock has had enough. He makes his contempt even more apparent.
1297,Shylock,"There's nothing we can do. No matter how great the sacrifices we make; no matter how gently we smile to them.... As long as we possess these unknown powers that make us stronger than them, they will see us as enemies. This ""cooperation"" they so insist on is merely a guise."
1298,Cain,Cut it out.
1299,Narrator,Cain shakes his head bitterly at their words.
1300,Cain,I agree that Minister Drummond and his agency take an overbearing stance towards wizards. I don't like their tactics either. But that doesn't mean all humans are like them. There has to be another path forward - one where wizards and humans can work together.
1301,Cock Robin,Yes! Yes! That's the sort of thing I wanted to say!
1302,Murr,So what should we do?
1303,Cain,Let's consult Sir Snow and Sir White.
1304,Murr,Sure. Here you go.
1305,Cain,.....? What is this frame.....?
1306,Heathcliff,A portrait of Sir Snow and Sir White....?
1307,Snow in the portrait,Sage.
1308,White in the portrait,Sage.
1309,Akira,"Woah, they spoke....."
1310,Snow in the portrait,It's the same as last night.
1311,White in the portrait,We've gotten trapped inside this portrait.
1312,Akira,What do you mean!?
1313,Cain,"Wait, so that wasn't a joke!?"
1314,Murr,"Ahaha, this is neat!"
1315,Snow in the portrait,"This is no laughing matter, Murr."
1316,White in the portrait,"For some reason, we can't use magic while we're in here."
1317,Snow in the portrait,"We've tried to escape the frame, but....."
1318,Snow & White in the portrait,Mmgh.....
1319,Narrator,The two of them slide out of the frame.
1320,Snow & White in the portrait,But this is our limit.
1321,Shylock,So you can come out of the portrait. Why are you playing around?
1322,Snow,Take a closer look.
1323,White,Our shadows are still stuck within the frame.
1324,Heathcliff,How did this happen....? Were you two cursed....?
1325,Snow,A curse....
1326,White,Perhaps it was.....
1327,Bradley,"Hey, you lot!"
1328,Narrator,"At that moment, Bradley appears. He grins widely, aggression written across his face."
1329,Bradley,I removed the barrier around the magic headquarters for you.
1330,Cain,You did what!?
1331,Bradley,"And now we're going to kill those bastards out there. If they attack us, we get to give them what they're looking for, right? I didn't get to have any fun during our battle with the < Great Catastrophe >, so I can't wait to give them a good fight."
1332,Cock Robin,W-wait! Please don't do anything violent!
1333,Heathcliff,You were the ones who attacked us first.
1334,Shylock,"Oh, dear. I fear that we might have an all-out war between humans and wizards before the < Great Catastrophe > attacks next year."
1335,Murr,Ahaha! Peace never lasts; that's just how it is!
1336,Narrator,"Portrait still in hand, Murr twirls around up into the air."
1337,Murr,"We only get along when we have the leisure to care for others. But the world is in absolute chaos now because of the < Great Catastrophe >! Neither humans nor wizards can afford to be kind right now, because they're all so worried about themselves. Just as I can love the < Great Catastrophe > when it gently illuminates the night sky, but must push it back when it gets too close."
1338,Narrator,Murr's eyes gleam like those of a mischievous cat; I can't tell whether he's being sarcastic or genuine.
1339,Akira,"(A war between humans and wizards...... That would be a complete disaster.) (That bearded old man might be infuriating, but that doesn't mean we should kill each other.) (I have to do something about this......)"
1340,Narrator,"In my desperation, I look at Bradley. I shiver at the sight of his combative grin. Up till now, I had thought of him as an older brother type, just with a quick temper. But the expression on his face is colder, more terrifying, and filled with more beast-like ferocity than the light of the < Great Catastrophe > itself."
1341,Snow,Bradley.
1342,White,Stop. You must not.
1343,Bradley,"Shut up, you old geezers. You really think I'm going to listen to you? Haha...... Seems like your magic really is weaker when you're trapped inside that painting."
1344,Narrator,(Sword unsheathed)
1345,Cain,"I won't let you, Bradley."
1346,Bradley,"Ahaha! Drawing your sword won't get you anywhere! Some upstart like you can't stop me! I am the great Northern wizard Bradley, leader of the Bandits of Death! I'll kill you all - humans and weak wizards alike!"
1347,Akira,......P-please stop......!
1348,Bradley,"Shut up! You've got some nerve, locking me up like that!"
1349,Akira,............
1350,Narrator,"I draw back in surprise at Bradley's raised voice. As I do, the feathers on my shawl flutter into the air."
1351,Bradley,"I'm never going back to that prison ce...... ......Ah, achoo!"
1352,Narrator,(Bradley disappears)
1353,Narrator,"And with that, Bradley disappears."
1354,Akira,.............!?
1355,Cain,......He disappeared!?
1356,Heathcliff,Where did he go!? Did he run away!?
1357,Snow,Bradley was not using magic.
1358,White,He was sent flying by some other force.
1359,Shylock,Some other force.... What a bizarre night this is shaping up to be.
1360,Murr,"But of course. We got so close to the < Great Catastrophe >, after all."
1361,Cain,"For now, we need to figure out how to handle the minister and his forces - they'll be here any moment now."
1362,Heathcliff,Any moment now?
1363,Cain,"Yeah. Cock Robin mentioned it earlier, remember? Don't worry. I'll handle....."
1364,Heathcliff,"Cain, can't you see? There are already soldiers gathered in the courtyard."
1365,Cain,No way....?
1366,Drummond,No need to hold back! Cock Robin should've gotten the Sage out of there!
1367,Soldier,The magic headquarters suddenly appeared out of thin air.....
1368,Soldier,Isn't this all a trap set up by the wizards?
1369,Drummond,"Do not flinch! We must punish the wizards for kidnapping the Sage! We need to place the Sage under our control so that we can tame those damn wizards before Prince Arthur finds out! How dare they turn me into a mouse! I'm going to squeakcure - secure my revenge!! Onwards, troops!"
1370,Narrator,(Soldiers chant)
1371,Shylock,"I suppose we have no choice but to fight. Let's go and shake them off, Murr."
1372,Murr,Okay!
1373,Akira,Please wait!
1374,Shylock,Sir Sage.....
1375,Akira,"Um, we're supposed to be fighting the < Great Catastrophe >, right? Why are we fighting against humans?"
1376,Heathcliff,Because they're attacking us.
1377,Akira,"Mister Cock Robin, why are you attacking the wizards?"
1378,Cock Robin,"We're not trying to attack them! We simply want to keep the wizards under control, because they're disturbing the peace......."
1379,Snow,"What a convenient definition of ""peace"" you have."
1380,White,"You made us fight the < Great Catastrophe >, and yet you demand even more of us."
1381,Cock Robin,That's because we can't fend it off ourselves! But we are grateful to you all!
1382,Murr,"Okay, then this is a party!"
1383,Cock Robin,"It's certainly not a party, but....."
1384,Akira,"(I see.... Humans are afraid of wizards....) (They believe the strength that protects them is also the power that could potentially hurt them.) (If wizards existed back in my world, would the same sort of thing have happened....?)"
1385,Narrator,That thought makes me very sad.
1386,Shylock,"Well, I'll head out and calm them down for now. Do not worry-...."
1387,Murr,Shylock?
1388,Shylock,....ugh.... ngh......!
1389,Heathcliff,Shylock....!?
1390,Cain,Shylock's chest is on fire.....!
1391,Narrator,"Shylock crouches down on the spot, clutching his chest in pain."
1392,Narrator,"Flames envelop Shylock's chest, right around the crest he showed me earlier. Shylock's face twists in pain as he forces himself to speak."
1393,Shylock,.....My heart.... ....My heart is on fire.......
1394,Murr,Shylock.....
1395,Shylock,.....gh.... Kuh.....
1396,Murr,Does it hurt?
1397,Shylock,....You horrible man...... Can't you tell......
1398,Snow,It seems like we truly are feeling the effects of the < Great Catastrophe >......
1399,White,We got too close to the < Great Catastrophe > - and suffered invisible wounds as a result of last night's battle.
1400,Heathcliff,We all did....!?
1401,Snow,"Indeed. We might not have realized it at the time, but our souls all sustained serious wounds."
1402,White,"And each of our wounds manifests itself differently. Take, for example, Cain's eyes and Bradley's disappearance. And us, trapped in our portrait."
1403,Cain,....What should we do.....?
1404,Soldiers,Aaaaaagh.....!
1405,Heathcliff,"....Here come the soldiers. Sir Sage, please stand behind me! I will protect you."
1406,Akira,But.....
1407,Cain,Heath! Take care of Shylock.... And also Sir Snow and Sir White!
1408,Heathcliff,"Got it... -Uh, that's a lot of people!?"
1409,Cain,Murr. You come with me. Tell me where the enemy is!
1410,Murr,Got it!
1411,Cain,I'll leave the rest to you!
1412,Narrator,(Footsteps)
1413,Heathcliff,Uh.... G-got it!
1414,Akira,"Heathcliff, please take care of Shylock. I'll hold Snow and White's portrait!"
1415,Heathcliff,"Thank you! Let's escape to the magic tower for now! Shylock, are you all right?"
1416,Shylock,.....gh.... I wonder.... Would you like to swap places with me and find out?
1417,Heathcliff,"No way, I don't want my heart to burn up..... ....I hope my wound isn't painful......"
1418,Shylock,Heh.... Saying that means you'll......
1419,Heathcliff,"Don't talk! It hurts, right?"
1420,Soldier,There they are! Get them.....!
1421,Narrator,Heath turns around while supporting Shylock on his shoulder. His pocket watch is in his hands.
1422,Heathcliff,<< Repsevaivulp Sonus >>
1423,Soldier,.......!
1424,Narrator,"Following Heathcliff's spell, the dining chairs and tables begin to creak and wrap around each other like entangled ivy. The barricade stops the soldiers from moving forward."
1425,Heathcliff,"Hurry, this way! Let's hide in the tower!"
1426,Narrator,"Heathcliff leads us to a tower with an elevator, much like the one I saw when I first arrived in this world. We rush into the tower and come to a halt."
1427,Heathcliff,We should be safe here... ......!
1428,Heathcliff,The courtyard is on fire! Someone must have shot a flaming arrow..... ....Do they hate us that much.....
1429,Snow,That's not it. They're simply afraid.
1430,White,Those overwhelmed with fear will do anything to protect themselves and those important to them.
1431,Heathcliff,But that doesn't mean they should.... ......!
1432,Shylock,.....The fire reached the tower.......
1433,Heathcliff,I'll extinguish it with magic! << Repsevaivulp... >>
1434,Narrator,(Door opens)
1435,Soldier,There they are! Get them with arrows!
1436,Soldier,We need to attack them before they kill us with their magical fire! Don't hold back! Wizards can't die!
1437,Shylock,Don't be ridiculo.... Uugh... gh....!
1438,Akira,Shylock!
1439,Soldier,Fire!
1440,Heathcliff,Sir Sage! Shylock!
1441,Narrator,"As Shylock crouches to the ground and I bend down to support him, the soldiers unleash a wave of arrows at us."
1442,Akira,.....!
1443,Narrator,"If those arrows strike their mark, will it hurt? Will I die? Will I never see my home again? Countless thoughts race through my head in a single moment. But right when the arrows are about to strike-.... A tranquil voice echoes across the room."
1444,Faust,<< Satillquinart Mullcreed >>
1445,Narrator,"In a flash, the arrows are engulfed in quiet flames and fall to the floor. The person standing beyond the embers that dance like burning petals is..... Faust - who had been on the verge of death."
1446,Heathcliff,Mr. Faust!
1447,Shylock,.....gh.... Faust.......
1448,Faust,....So the humans came to attack us......
1449,Narrator,It's clear that he hasn't recovered yet - Faust's shoulders heave with pain as he sneers.
1450,Faust,"That sounds just like them..... They're quick to fear, quick to welter, and quick to attack. I'm sick of playing their games. -If you so dearly desire an eternal slumber, I'll grant it to you. Right now."
1451,Soldier,......!
1452,Snow,Faust. Stop.
1453,White,Hurting humans will only exacerbate the problem. You must hold back.
1454,Faust,"I did hold back. In the distant past. And you know exactly how my story ended. ....Humans simply repeat history, time and again......"
1455,Narrator,"That's when the doors on the other side of the room begin to creak. Thump, clatter - the sound of something being carried this way."
1456,Akira,(Those doors. Is that an elevator....?)
1457,Shylock,.....The elevator......
1458,White,They've been summoned!
1459,Snow,The new wizards are coming!
1460,Heathcliff,The new wizards......
1461,Soldier,More wizards are coming to attack us!?
1462,Soldier,R-run....!
1463,Narrator,"The doors slowly open. And one by one, the wizards step out."
1464,Shino,"I'm Shino, an Eastern wizard. I'll be in your care."
1465,Heathcliff,......Shino.......
1466,Nero,".......Eastern wizard, Nero. ......Well, nice to meet you......"
1467,Riquet,"I'm Riquet, a Central wizard. I don't know much about the outside world, but...... Please take care of me."
1468,Rustica,"I'm Rustica, a Western wizard. Thank you for inviting me here. By the way, has anyone seen my bride?"
1469,Chloe,"I'm the Western wizard Chloe! I've been travelling the world with Rustica, and I used to be a tailor. Um, I hope we can get along!"
1470,Rutile,"I'm Rutile, a Southern wizard. I was a teacher in the South. I'm glad to meet you all."
1471,Mitile,"I'm Mitile, a wizard of the South! I'm the great witch Tiretta's son. Ahem. Pleased to meet you."
1472,Lennox,....Lennox. I'm a Southern wizard. Nice to meet you.
1473,Figaro,I'm the Southern wizard Figaro. Please take care of me.
1474,Arthur,"I'm Arthur, a Central wizard. Sir Sage, I look forward to working with you."
1475,Arthur,......! What in the world is going on here!?
1476,Chloe,A fire!? And soldiers!? What's happening!?
1477,Rustica,"I put on my best introduction, but it looks like everyone is rather busy at the moment."
1478,Nero,"Oh, come on....."
1479,Riquet,....So this is the outside world......
1480,Mitile,Are the Sage's wizards being attacked by soldiers? But why?
1481,Shino,Who cares why? I'm here to help the Sage's wizards. I'll put them down right now.
1482,Figaro,Wait a second.
1483,Shino,What?
1484,Figaro,"We shouldn't attack the military using magic - it'll just complicate things for the future. Leno, can I count on you?"
1485,Lennox,Got it.
1486,Rutile,Mister Leno! Let me help you!
1487,Lennox,No. Stand back; it's dangerous.
1488,Narrator,(Footsteps)
1489,Mitile,H-he's kind of cool......
1490,Narrator,"One after another, new faces step through the elevator doors. I can't really make out what each of them looks like from a distance, but I notice a tall young man approaching us."
1491,Soldier,H-he's gonna kill us! Fire your arrows!
1492,Soldier,Make a run for it when he flinches.....!
1493,Heathcliff,Stop!
1494,Narrator,"The soldiers prepare their arrows. But before they can even draw their bows, the young man leaps off the ground and lands right in front of them. Immediately after his feet strike the ground, he delivers a sweeping kick and knocks out the soldiers surrounding him."
1495,Lennox,.....!
1496,Rutile & Mitile,So cool.....!
1497,Nero,....What is that guy? A mercenary?
1498,Figaro,"No, he's a shepherd."
1499,Nero,A shepherd!?
1500,Riquet,....I don't know any shepherds like him......
1501,Shino,He's huge.....
1502,Soldier,Aaaaaagh........!
1503,Soldier,Run....!
1504,Narrator,(Footsteps)
1505,Narrator,"The soldiers flee, pulling their injured comrades along. The tall young man offers us his hand."
1506,Lennox,Are you all right?
1507,Akira,Thank you......
1508,Narrator,"But as he helps me and Shylock back to our feet, his eyes widen. His astonished gaze is fixed directly on Faust. Faust, too, holds his breath."
1509,Faust,You......
1510,Lennox,.....Sir Faust.......
1511,Drummond,These damn wizards...... Did they use fire magic!? Are they trying to burn our soldiers to the ground!?
1512,Soldier,Sir Drummond! We've been ordered to stop fighting!
1513,Drummond,Ordered to stop fighting!? Who aside from me is allowed to issue commands to these soldiers!?
1514,Soldier,Well......
1515,Drummond,What!? Prince Arthur has been summoned as one of the new Sage's wizards!?
1516,Narrator,(Arthur appears)
1517,Arthur,Minister! Why did you attack the magic headquarters!?
1518,Drummond,"P-Prince Arthur......! It's because the wizards attacked my subordinates, and......"
1519,Arthur,You were the ones who attacked them! I clearly recall telling you to let them rest and to invite them to the castle! This is a time in which humans and wizards need to work together to take down the < Great Catastrophe >. I can't believe what you've done.....
1520,Drummond,"It's for your sake, Prince Arthur! I'm trying to make sure these wizards won't trick you into-...."
1521,Arthur,"Stop calling them ""these wizards."" I too am a wizard. Have I ever tried to deceive you? Is that how you've felt about me for all these years?"
1522,Drummond,Ah.......
1523,Arthur,.....Please apologize and help to restore the magic headquarters. Anyone would be furious if you attacked their home. We're the same - aren't we also grieving because the < Great Catastrophe > destroyed our town and castle?
1524,Drummond,...... ......My apologies......
1525,Murr,"Shylock, are you okay?"
1526,Shylock,"It seems to have subsided.... Were you worried about me, Murr?"
1527,Murr,"Did it make your heart pound? Did you cry? Man, if you cried, I wish I could have seen it myself!"
1528,Shylock,"Fufu. One day, I'll inflict the exact same pain on you, and take delight in your screams as I open a fresh bottle of wine. Just you wait."
1529,Cain,....Sigh.... What a ruckus. And suddenly we have so many people.....
1530,Narrator,I glance around the now-lively dining room.
1531,Mitile,"Mister Lennox, I didn't know you were so strong! You were really cool back there!"
1532,Lennox,"Ah, thanks. ....I wonder where he went......"
1533,Rutile,It was amazing. Please show us that move one more time!
1534,Lennox,It's really nothing impressive......
1535,Rutile & Mitile,"Please, please!"
1536,Lennox,........... Hah......!
1537,Rutile & Mitile,Wow~....!
1538,Shino,Those guys are so excitable..... Are they from the South?
1539,Figaro,And you're the hot-blooded kid from earlier. Are you by chance the Eastern wizard Shino?
1540,Shino,I am. How did you know?
1541,Figaro,"I heard from a friend of mine that there was a young, powerful wizard in the East, and you seemed to fit the description."
1542,Shino,Description?
1543,Figaro,Small and-....
1544,Shino,What's your name?
1545,Figaro,I'm the Southern wizard Figaro.
1546,Shino,"Figaro. I'll get real tall next year, and look down on that head of yours."
1547,Figaro,"Ahahaha, my bad. Let's get along, Shino."
1548,Shino,Hmph.......
1549,Mitile,"Who is that guy....? Wasn't he being kind of rude to you, Dr. Figaro?"
1550,Figaro,He's the guardian of the Eastern forest. The woodlands there are so dense and vast that they're impossible to navigate without a guide. I hear Shino is an excellent guide. He's a wizard with a promising future ahead of him.
1551,Mitile,"Huh, that's amazing..... But I'm good at giving people directions too. And I know how to read maps."
1552,Figaro,"You're right, Mitile. You've got a promising future as well."
1553,Mitile,Ehehe.
1554,Rutile,Here we go. I'll help you guys clean up. Where should I put this chair?
1555,Soldier,T-take it over there.
1556,Rutile,"All right. Mister Lennox, they want it over here."
1557,Lennox,"Got it. Rutile, your pocket."
1558,Rutile,My pocket?
1559,Lennox,Your pen's about to fall.....
1560,Narrator,(Clatter)
1561,Rutile,"Woah.... Ahaha. Mister Leno, you speak so leisurely."
1562,Lennox,Haha. Sorry.
1563,Soldier,"....Um, you dropped your pen."
1564,Rutile,"Oh, how kind of you. Thank you very much."
1565,Soldier,A wizard said thank you......
1566,Soldier,A-are you sure he wasn't just being sarcastic? Or maybe he was cursing us.....
1567,Rutile,Ah!
1568,Soldier,.....! Wh-what is it!?
1569,Rutile,Poor soul - you're injured.
1570,Soldier,This is because your fellow wizards-....!
1571,Rutile,<< Ortonik Setomaouge >>
1572,Soldier,...........
1573,Rutile,There we go. You should be fine now; please take care.
1574,Soldier,.....Th-thank you......
1575,Lennox,What's wrong?
1576,Rutile,"He was injured, so I healed his wounds. It looks like everyone is hurt all over."
1577,Lennox,"Well, getting injured is a soldier's job, after all."
1578,Rutile,"That's incredible. I'd be so concerned if the same thing happened to my students. I was surprised they were waging an all-out battle back there, but if they're the kind of people who can say thank you, I believe we can get along with them."
1579,Nero,"........... God, what am I going to do about my restaurant.... No, I guess I can't even work there anymore. They've probably caught on that I'm a wizard....."
1580,Riquet,Excuse me......
1581,Nero,......What?
1582,Riquet,I'd like to speak with whoever is in charge here.
1583,Nero,Sigh......
1584,Riquet,There's a strange mark on my forehead - the fact that it's so prominent is causing me trouble. Are you an authorized party?
1585,Nero,"Nope, I was dragged into this too. Go find someone else if you have a complaint......"
1586,Riquet,I see. Thank you.
1587,Nero,You're welcome. Sigh...... I want to go home......
1588,Riquet,"Um, excuse me."
1589,Chloe,"Yes, yes!"
1590,Riquet,"Sorry for the sudden request, but could you erase this mark from my forehead? I'll leave immediately once that's done."
1591,Chloe,Huh? You can erase this thing? Rustica said you couldn't.
1592,Riquet,Eh? I can't have that......
1593,Chloe,"I feel you. Sometimes you just want to switch up your style - I want it to match my outfit for the day, you know?"
1594,Riquet,"Dressing up is an extravagance for the vain. Wizards, who are the disciples of God, need to be frugal......"
1595,Chloe,What's a disciple of god.....? You don't like dressing up.....?
1596,Riquet,I see you've been tainted by worldly desires. How tragic.
1597,Chloe,S-sorry......
1598,Riquet,Where is this person in charge called Mister Rustica?
1599,Chloe,Person in charge?
1600,Riquet,"You heard about this mark on my forehead from Mister Rustica, right?"
1601,Chloe,"Oh, Rustica just happened to know about it. But I wouldn't say he's in charge of anything......"
1602,Rustica,You called for me?
1603,Chloe,"Oh, this is Rustica. I'm Chloe. What's your name?"
1604,Riquet,"My name is Riquet. Mister Rustica, if you're not the person in charge here, who is your superior?"
1605,Rustica,My superior? You mean in terms of age? Or height?
1606,Riquet,Someone with a position superior to yours.
1607,Rustica,"Then I guess that would be my bride? I would follow any order of hers, no matter what she told me to do. For her, I would become a warrior who puts my life on the line, or a faithful and devoted servant. Doesn't that sound wonderful?"
1608,Riquet,I understand. It is our duty as the disciples of God.
1609,Rustica,Great; I think we will get along.
1610,Riquet,Fufu...... Yes.
1611,Chloe,"You guys are on totally different wavelengths, but you still managed to become friends. Can you teach me how to do that?"
1612,Narrator,"As I gaze at the lively scene in front of me, someone approaches our group. We only exchanged brief greetings earlier, but I immediately recognize him as Prince Arthur. He carries himself with a dashing air; his manners are graceful and elegant with a touch of reserve...... His eyes shine with an innocence purer than that of fairy tale princes."
1613,Arthur,Sir Sage.
1614,Narrator,"When Prince Arthur catches sight of me, he kneels before me, bowing his head deeply. A stir of uncertainty runs through the soldiers surrounding us."
1615,Arthur,"I am Arthur, the prince of Central Country. I deeply apologize for this commotion. Everything that happened was due to my sheer incompetence. Please forgive us."
1616,Soldier,"P-Prince Arthur is kneeling...... We can't be standing then. H-hey, get down."
1617,Narrator,"All of the soldiers drop to their knees. Flustered, I crouch down as well."
1618,Akira,D-don't say that...... Please raise your head.
1619,Heathcliff,......Sir Sage is kneeling. Should we kneel too?
1620,Cain,I guess so...... Let's put Sir Snow and Sir White's portrait face down for now.
1621,Heathcliff,Okay.
1622,Snow in the portrait,Hey! Cain!
1623,White in the portrait,Don't do that! Put us back up!
1624,Akira,Prince Arthur. I've heard so much about you. Or rather...... I've read so much about you in the previous sage's manual.
1625,Narrator,"Prince Arthur looks up, and his gaze meets mine. His eyes are so clear and straightforward that I feel myself almost swallowed by their depth. He must be in a difficult position as a prince. Yet there's nothing twisted or hostile about him; it's clear that he's a pure and earnest soul."
1626,Arthur,"The sage's manual...... If you can read those words, that must mean you came from the same country as he did - Japan."
1627,Akira,"Yes, I think so....... The previous sage said you were like a kind little brother to him."
1628,Arthur,......He wrote that about me......
1629,Narrator,"Arthur smiles, a little sadly."
1630,Arthur,"I regret not being able to say a proper goodbye, but I'm glad to hear that. And I am also happy to meet you, Sir Sage."
1631,Arthur,"Like him, you also came from a distant world, right?"
1632,Akira,Yes. And I'd like to return to my world...... That's why I wanted to meet you.
1633,Arthur,"I see...... Forgive me; I might have been waylaid by my responsibilities as the prince, but it still took me far too long to arrive. Unfortunately, we have yet to find a means of returning the sage to the world they came from. But we did gather many of our greatest scholars to search for a path between worlds, and their research continues to this day. You, Sir Sage, and we, the chosen wizards...... The structure of this world remains a complete mystery to all of us. I wasn't able to help the previous sage, but this time, for real - I hope to discover how you may return to your world. Until then, please... Could you lend us your strength?"
1634,Narrator,"I fall silent at Arthur's words. But strangely enough, I don't feel despair. I still feel anxious, and it's not like I've given up on returning home, but somehow - I'm still optimistic."
1635,Akira,......I understand.
1636,Arthur,......Sir Sage...... I'm sorry I couldn't meet your expectations.
1637,Akira,"Please, don't worry about it. Ah...... To be honest, I still really want to go home. But you - and everyone else here - have been so kind to me...... And I'd like to learn more about this world, so...... ......And, tonight...... Watching the wizards and humans fight made me think that maybe there is something I can do......"
1638,Narrator,"The gentle night breeze carries in a scent - not of flowers, or of water, but of smoke. I murmur, looking out at the charred, smoldering remnants of the courtyard. In the end, we still don't know who set the fire first - was it the humans, or the wizards? I don't think it was the wizards. But this is how war occurs. None of the wizards are terrifying people. But the bearded old man and the soldiers were all afraid of them. Isn't that fear the reason for the deep divide that exists between them? I lower my gaze, unable to put my feelings into words. But Arthur seems to understand the emotions behind my silence, and nods gravely."
1639,Arthur,"Sir Sage. I feel the same way. I believe humans and wizards can build a better relationship with each other. I pray for the day when wizards and humans are able to trust each other and work together. To that end, I hope you will share your wisdom with us, Sir Sage. I look forward to working with you."
1640,Narrator,"As Arthur gently takes my hand, I notice the crest on the back of his hand. The warmth of his palm and his bright, guileless smile make me feel like we could become friends."
1641,Akira,Yes! I'd love to be of help.
1642,Arthur,"Thank you, Sir Sage."
1643,Narrator,"Arthur smiles happily. Suddenly, his gaze wanders around furtively as if he's looking for something - for someone. Our eyes meet, and Arthur, with childish nervousness in his expression, asks hesitantly."
1644,Arthur,Um...... Would you happen to know where Sir Oz is......
1645,Narrator,"At his question, I recall the remark in the sage's manual: Oz and Prince Arthur don't seem to get along."
1646,Akira,Ah...... He's not around right now. So don't worry.
1647,Arthur,Is that so......
1648,Narrator,"Arthur sighs, disappointed. His unexpected reaction makes me feel like I've gotten the wrong idea."
1649,Akira,(Huh? So maybe they do get along?)
1650,Narrator,"Arthur also picks up on the implication behind my words, and blinks with wide, curious eyes as he asks me:"
1651,Arthur,"What do you mean, ""don't worry""?"
1652,Akira,"Ah, well...... I thought you didn't want to run into each other......"
1653,Arthur,Did Sir Oz say that to you?
1654,Narrator,"Arthur looks stricken with shock, his bright eyes wide open with sadness. Well, it seems like Arthur, at the very least, doesn't hate Oz. I hurriedly shake my head."
1655,Akira,"No, I think I've just misunderstood something. Sorry, don't worry about it."
1656,Arthur,Is that so......
1657,Narrator,"Arthur breathes a sigh of relief, his hand on his chest; it's a boyish gesture, fitting for his age."
1658,Akira,"Are you acquainted with Oz, Prince Arthur?"
1659,Arthur,"Please call me Arthur, Sir Sage. Rather than acquaintances, Sir Oz and I are......"
1660,Narrator,(Footsteps)
1661,Cock Robin,Your Highness! We've more or less finished cleaning up the magic headquarters!
1662,Narrator,"Cock Robin interrupts, cutting Arthur off."
1663,Cock Robin,"We still need to tidy up a few things here and there, so we can continue working if necessary, but......"
1664,Arthur,"No, it's already late. Everyone must be exhausted, so please go home, and come back another day to take care of repairs."
1665,Cock Robin,"I understand. What about you, Your Highness?"
1666,Arthur,"I'll stay here, and head back after I've spoken with the other wizards."
1667,Cock Robin,Then let me arrange for a bodyguard......
1668,Arthur,I don't need one. This isn't a battlefield.
1669,Cock Robin,But the roads are dangerous at night.
1670,Arthur,"What's so dangerous about them? I'm not a sheltered princess, and unlike you guys, I can fly. There's nothing scary about a bright night like this. Rather, let me illuminate the way back with magic so you can all return safely - the lights will watch over you."
1671,Narrator,"Arthur flashes a playful smile at a worried Cock Robin. He soars slowly into the night sky, the wind draping gently around his form."
1672,Narrator,"As he floats underneath the huge, bright moon, Arthur recites a string of curious words."
1673,Arthur,<< Pernoctant Nixzo >>
1674,Narrator,"The dark night road is illuminated with flickering, gentle lights that lead out from the magic headquarters and into the distance. A pang of nostalgia strikes my chest: the sight reminds me of the lights spilling out from the windows of the last train home from work. The lights glow warmly, beckoning with the promise of home; I'm sure they will bring comfort to the people who see them. Looking up at Arthur, Cock Robin murmurs in a low voice."
1675,Cock Robin,"What a kind person he is...... Even though his own mother, the Queen, abandoned him in the Northern mountains when he was a child......"
1676,Akira,Huh......?
1677,Narrator,"Cock Robin averts his gaze with a start, as if he's said something he shouldn't have. Before I can ask him about it, Arthur lands back on the ground."
1678,Arthur,There. You should be fine now.
1679,Cock Robin,"Thank you, Prince Arthur."
1680,Arthur,Be careful on your way home.
1681,Cock Robin,Yes.
1682,Narrator,"As he turns to leave, Cock Robin bows stiffly in my direction."
1683,Cock Robin,"I'm very sorry for everything that happened, Sir Sage. Please convey my apologies to the wizards as well. I'll be taking my leave, then....."
1684,Narrator,Arthur smiles as he watches Cock Robin and the soldiers depart.
1685,Arthur,"Like him, there are people who are willing to understand wizards...... Step by step, I hope we can all move forward in the same way, and change how things currently stand."
1686,Akira,I feel the same way......
1687,Arthur,"Sir Sage, how are you feeling tonight? Are you exhausted?"
1688,Akira,"Oh no, I'm fine."
1689,I can hardly believe my ears,did the prince suddenly start speaking like a party animal?
1690,Akira,M-mixer......?
1691,Arthur,"Yes. Before we talk about building bridges between wizards and humans, I think we need to communicate with each other first as wizards. I will prepare an official welcome reception at another time. But before that, I'd like to throw a mixer with everyone tonight."
1692,Akira,"Um, may I ask a question?"
1693,Arthur,Of course.
1694,Akira,"What do you mean when you say ""mixer""......"
1695,Arthur,"Oh, I apologize. The previous sage mentioned it, so I assumed you knew what it was. A mixer is a banquet to celebrate new encounters. Don't you think it's the perfect event for tonight?"
1696,Akira,(The previous sage sure had a way with words....... How am I supposed to correct him.......) Y-You're right. I agree.
1697,Arthur,"Great! Then let's get this mixer started right away. Do you like mixers, Sir Sage?"
1698,Akira,"Uh, um, good question......"
1699,Arthur,The previous sage seemed to love them. He said he would definitely invite me if he ever held one here in this world. Deepening the bonds between humans and wizards...... Perhaps you can truly call it the ultimate mixer between humans and wizards.
1700,Narrator,I break out into a cold sweat at the serious expression on Arthur's face. I really should have corrected him earlier.
1701,Arthur,"I'm thinking of setting aside a day of national celebration, and calling it ""National Mixer Day""."
1702,Akira,P-perhaps you should come up with a different name for a national holiday?
1703,Arthur,You think so?
1704,Akira,Y-Yes.
1705,Arthur,"Well, I guess for now we can just enjoy the mixer in front of our eyes with everyone here."
1706,Narrator,"And thus began our midnight tea party - the wizards' mixer. According to the sage's manual, the wizards' personalities varied depending on where they were from, so I had them group together by country. It seems like some of them know about fellow wizards from their same country."
1707,Arthur,"I'm Arthur, a wizard from Central. I've met Cain before."
1708,Cain,I was a knight of Central Country. It's an honor to meet you again like this.
1709,Riquet,"I'm Riquet, a Central wizard. I was a disciple of God who spread the teachings of the Church. Excuse me, who is the person in charge here?"
1710,Cain,"Person in charge...... Sir Sage only just arrived, so......"
1711,Shylock,"If we're going by age, shouldn't it be Sir Snow and Sir White, since they're the oldest?"
1712,Snow,Stop shoving responsibility onto the elderly.
1713,White,"We've lived this long because we avoided taking responsibility for anything, you know?"
1714,Murr,"Isn't it Oz? He's not here right now, but he is the strongest."
1715,Narrator,"Upon hearing Oz's name, Arthur shifts in his seat, his restlessness apparent. Next to him, Riquet's face - as lovely as a maiden's - hardens into a frown."
1716,Riquet,So Oz is the person in charge then? I see. When will he be here?
1717,Arthur,That's an excellent question. Does anyone know?
1718,Narrator,"His question is met with silence from the table. Arthur looks crestfallen, and Riquet raises an eyebrow."
1719,Arthur,So nobody knows......
1720,Riquet,So nobody knows at all?
1721,Cain,"I'll introduce him instead. Oz is a Central wizard. He used to be the instructor of the Central wizards...... He was our... What was the word? He was our teacher and trainer. He's the strongest wizard of us all. I'm sure many of you know of him, but he doesn't really show his face around here often. That's it for our introductions. Could the Western wizards introduce themselves next?"
1722,Shylock,"I'm the Western wizard Shylock. I was the teacher of the Western wizards - just in name, though."
1723,Murr,I'm the Western wizard Murr! I love shiny things!
1724,Rustica,Murr? Are you the famous philosopher?
1725,Narrator,"The young man with the bearing of a noble looks at Murr, surprised."
1726,Rustica,"How unexpected. I'm honored to meet you, Philosopher Murr."
1727,Chloe,Do you know him?
1728,Rustica,"He's a very knowledgeable scholar, and one of the greatest minds of our era. His research involves the truth of the universe, and the < Great Catastrophe >."
1729,Chloe,"Wow, that's incredible!"
1730,Murr,"Grrr~, woof woof!!"
1731,Chloe,.............!? What was that!? Is this what they say about the thin line between geniuses and freaks?
1732,Rustica,What a magnificent cry. I'm impressed.
1733,Shylock,It's been a while since I met someone with praise for Murr. May I ask for your names?
1734,Rustica,"My, I apologize. My name is Rustica. And this is Chloe."
1735,Chloe,"Hello, I'm Chloe. I've been traveling with Rustica, and he's been teaching me magic over the course of our journey. That's why I'm like Rustica's pupil. My dream is to become the best tailor in the land!"
1736,Shylock,Were you traveling with a purpose? Or was it a journey without a goal?
1737,Rustica,We're on a journey to find my lost bride.
1738,Shylock,"A journey of love, I see. What kind of person is she?"
1739,Rustica,She's a wonderful person.
1740,Shylock,Anything else?
1741,Rustica,She's a wonderful person.
1742,Chloe,"Um, I'm sorry.... It's kind of, uh, really hard to explain...."
1743,Shylock,No worries. I'm quite familiar with lunatics.
1744,Murr,Lunatics are the best! I love all things weird!
1745,Narrator,Rustica turns his gaze on me with an elegant smile.
1746,Rustica,"Sir Sage, you came from an unknown world - were you on a journey too?"
1747,Akira,"I wasn't traveling, but...... Before I knew it, I ended up here."
1748,Rustica,That's nice. You didn't have to go through the trouble of packing.
1749,Akira,A-ahaha. That's true.
1750,Chloe,"How are you going to get back? Can I visit your world too, Sir Sage?"
1751,Akira,We actually don't know how I can return yet...... We're currently searching for a way.
1752,Chloe,Oh...... I see. I'm sorry.
1753,Narrator,"Chloe takes in my predicament, and furrows his brows in sympathy. But his face immediately brightens up with an encouraging smile."
1754,Chloe,"Then, when you find out how to get home, take me with you! Until then, I'll make lots of clothes for you, Sir Sage."
1755,Akira,Thank you.
1756,Rustica,Chloe is very clever with his hands.
1757,Chloe,"Ehehe. See, I designed and made Rustica's clothes. I'll make clothes for everyone else too!"
1758,Shylock,"Faust, how about you ask him to make you some clothes? Weren't yours ruined during our last battle?"
1759,Narrator,"Faust, who had been drinking his tea, gives Shylock a wordless gaze. Shylock smiles and continues talking."
1760,Shylock,Please introduce the Eastern wizards next.
1761,Narrator,"In the sage's manual, it says that the Eastern wizards hate humans. True to their description, they look more uncomfortable than anyone else in the room. They were the first to grab the seats at the end of the table."
1762,Faust,............
1763,Narrator,"Faust places his cup on the table. His gaze is fixed downwards as he interlocks his fingers and falls into a long, deep silence."
1764,Akira,"Um, if you're still feeling unwell, please don't force yourself......"
1765,Faust,"Eastern wizard, Faust."
1766,Chloe,....Anything else?
1767,Faust,No.
1768,Heathcliff,Ah.... Mr. Faust kept all the Eastern wizards together. He's my teacher.
1769,Narrator,"Heathcliff adds on timidly, trying to help. But Faust simply furrows his eyebrows even more."
1770,Faust,There is no reason for you to treat me like a teacher.
1771,Heathcliff,But.....
1772,Faust,Two of us turned to stone.
1773,Narrator,"Faust's voice is hoarse. A heavy silence falls across the room. I don't know what to say, but as I struggle to find the right words, two voices speak up at the same time."
1774,Lennox,In the previous battle.....
1775,Figaro,The catastrophe.....
1776,Lennox,"Ah, go ahead, Dr. Figaro."
1777,Figaro,"No, you speak first."
1778,Riquet,Excuse me.
1779,Narrator,"As the Southern wizards press each other to speak first, Riquet raises his hand. For some reason, Murr calls on him like a teacher."
1780,Murr,"Yes, Riquet. You may speak."
1781,Riquet,"You said your name was Faust. Are you by any chance the holy wizard Faust, who was said to be involved in the founding of the Central Country Kingdom?"
1782,Narrator,Faust refuses to meet his gaze.
1783,Faust,You have the wrong person.
1784,Riquet,But.....
1785,Faust,............
1786,Akira,"Ah... Um, there was a wizard like that?"
1787,Riquet,Yes. He's a noble wizard who dedicated his life to serving humans. Father Priest always told me to look to him as my role model.
1788,Faust,Heathcliff. You're next.
1789,Heathcliff,"Ah.... Yes. I'm Heathcliff, a wizard from Eastern Country. ....Please take care of me."
1790,Cain,"Heath and I are close in age, so we hung out pretty often. I'll introduce you later, Prince Arthur. You too, Riquet."
1791,Arthur,I see. Nice to meet you.
1792,Riquet,Nice to meet you......
1793,Heathcliff,Ah.... Yes. Hi.
1794,Faust,Keep going in order.
1795,Nero,"Okay, guess I'm next, then...... I'm Nero. Uh..... That's all."
1796,Faust,Are you stupid? You told us absolutely nothing about yourself.
1797,Nero,You pretty much did the same.......
1798,Faust,What was that?
1799,Nero,"Nevermind..... Uh, I ran a restaurant in Eastern Country."
1800,Mitile,"Nii-sama, did you hear that? He ran his own restaurant."
1801,Rutile,That's amazing. You must be a wonderful chef.
1802,Nero,"Uh, thanks..... And that's why I'd like to go back as soon as I can...... The < Great Catastrophe > only attacks once a year, right? I'll just show up when the time comes. Sorry, but does that sound all right to you all?"
1803,Shylock,"That's absolutely fine. Up till now, no one but the Sage lived in this building - the only time we all got together was to defeat the catastrophe....."
1804,Cain,"Wait. Hold up one second. I was going to bring this up later, but... As everyone here knows, the < Great Catastrophe > this year was different - it was powerful."
1805,Cain,"It turned ten of our comrades to stone. In order to prevent such a tragedy from repeating itself, we need to train together and plan ahead; I want us to build our sense of unity as a group."
1806,Nero,....What are you trying to say?
1807,Cain,We're all going to live here together and prepare for the next attack.
1808,Cain,We're all going to live here together and prepare for the next attack.
1809,Snow,I think that's a good plan.
1810,White,"I agree. We have ten new wizards, after all. It would be quite difficult for all of us to work together on short notice."
1811,Snow,"On top of that, there's the issue of our bizarre injuries. How does that sound to you all?"
1812,Narrator,"I look across the room, surveying everyone's reactions. All of the Eastern wizards immediately look disgusted."
1813,Faust,Living together.....?
1814,Heathcliff,Here? For a whole year....?
1815,Nero,I would seriously rather not.....
1816,Narrator,But there is one Eastern wizard who voices his agreement.
1817,Shino,I'm fine with that. I can sleep anywhere so long as I have a roof over my head.
1818,Cain,And you are?
1819,Shino,"Shino, an Eastern wizard. I'm the guardian of Sherwood Forest, and a servant of the Blanchett family."
1820,Faust,....The Blanchett family? So you mean Heath's family?
1821,Narrator,Heathcliff steals a sideways glance at Shino before nodding with a sigh.
1822,Heathcliff,....Shino is my childhood friend.
1823,Narrator,Faust looks at the two of them and raises his eyebrows in exasperation.
1824,Faust,....Why don't any of you know how to introduce yourselves?
1825,Nero,"I mean, considering the example that you set....."
1826,Faust,Shino.
1827,Shino,What.
1828,Heathcliff,"Hey, be polite. Mr. Faust is our teacher."
1829,Shino,I haven't learned a single thing from him. Besides his name.
1830,Faust,And I haven't been paid for any services. Are you Heathcliff's friend?
1831,Narrator,Shino shoots a quick glare in Heathcliff's direction.
1832,Shino,No. We're not friends.
1833,Narrator,Heathcliff looks ready to pop a vein.
1834,Heathcliff,"Oh, is that so?"
1835,I can feel a sharp tension in the air,"the two of them are keenly aware of each other, yet stubbornly refuse to make eye contact."
1836,Shino,I serve Master and Mistress - Heath just happens to be their child.
1837,Heathcliff,"Yes, that's right. And you just happen to be one of our servants."
1838,Shino,Exactly.
1839,Heathcliff,I see how it is.
1840,Shino,Hmph.
1841,Nero,What's going on...? Are you two fighting....?
1842,Heathcliff & Shino,Not at all.
1843,Faust,"And I don't care. But Shino, listen to me."
1844,Shino,What.
1845,Faust,"This was Heathcliff's first battle. And it was a bitter, traumatic one: he lost two comrades right before his eyes."
1846,Shino,..........
1847,Heathcliff,............
1848,Faust,"Be kind to him, at least for tonight."
1849,Shino,.....Got it.
1850,Faust,Good. That's it for Eastern Country introductions. Next.
1851,Narrator,"I look at Faust in surprise. He has an unapproachable air, but he isn't unkind."
1852,Akira,(And I hear he was gravely injured protecting his comrade....)
1853,Figaro,"I guess we'll go through our introductions next. But first, can I ask a question?"
1854,Akira,Ah... Go ahead.
1855,Figaro,Did the Southern wizards chosen before us all turn to stone?
1856,Narrator,"Every wizard who fought against the < Great Catastrophe > falls silent at Figaro's question. After a long pause, the twins nod."
1857,Snow,They did.
1858,White,The kind Southern wizards stepped forward and tried to protect the rest of us.....
1859,Mitile,....So they really.....
1860,Rutile,".....I see..... They were such kind people, after all......"
1861,Lennox,............
1862,Narrator,"A cloud hangs over the Southern wizards' expressions. I, too, am shocked. So I hadn't met a Southern wizard until now because they had all passed away."
1863,Figaro,"I see..... Ah, I mean. I had prepared myself for this news, as unfortunate as it is. But if that's the case.... Then I can agree to living together. I don't want to let these boys turn to stone. I want to train them so they're prepared to fight the < Great Catastrophe >."
1864,Mitile,"Train us.... You say that, but doesn't that go for you too, Dr. Figaro? You can't use strong magic either. Plus, you said your back hurts because you rarely get to exercise."
1865,Figaro,Ahahaha. Good point.
1866,Snow,Figaro.
1867,White,Oh Figaro.
1868,Figaro,Can the cute little twins over there stay quiet for a second?
1869,Snow,He called us cute.
1870,White,Then I guess we can stay quiet.
1871,Rutile,Do you know those twins?
1872,Figaro,"Somewhat. Ah, excuse me, I'm getting sidetracked. Let me introduce myself again. I'm Figaro, a Southern wizard. I run a small clinic in Southern Country."
1873,Rustica,So you're a doctor? That's wonderful.
1874,Figaro,"Thank goodness I'm a wizard. Because even if I slip up during a surgery, I can always get away with it by turning my patient into a zombie."
1875,Rustica,..........
1876,Figaro,I'm just kidding.
1877,Rutile,I'm Rutile. I teach at a school in the South. And this is my little brother Mitile.
1878,Mitile,"I'm Mitile. I'm in school, but I'm also learning magic from Dr. Figaro. I'm still learning and improving, but I'll become a great wizard one day! So please don't look down on us just because we're from the South."
1879,Narrator,I can't help but smile at Mitile's enthusiasm. I remember how I wanted to get good grades and impress my teachers when I had just started attending school.
1880,Akira,Of course. Please do your best.
1881,Mitile,Thank you!
1882,Shino,But Southern wizards are weak.
1883,Mitile,............
1884,Shino,"Plus, they're easily swayed by their emotions. No matter where you go, Southern wizards just drag the rest of us down."
1885,Heathcliff,Shino!
1886,Shino,It's better to tell them now - so they won't get wiped out later.
1887,Mitile,"....Yeah, well, Eastern wizards have terrible personalities and foul mouths."
1888,Rutile,"Hey now, Mitile!"
1889,Shino,What?
1890,Heathcliff,What?
1891,Nero,What?
1892,Faust,What?
1893,Mitile,"Eastern wizards and Northern wizards give all of us wizards a bad reputation! You guys were fighting against the Central Country army earlier today, too!"
1894,Faust,"Oh? Are you saying the wizards of Southern Country would've solved the problem by letting them burn you to the ground? I see. So that's what you're teaching them, Figaro."
1895,Figaro,"Don't take it the wrong way, Faust."
1896,Mitile,Dr. Figaro! You said that wizards and humans should help each other!
1897,Figaro,I did say that. I sure did say that.
1898,Faust,You irresponsible man..... You haven't changed in the least.
1899,Figaro,"Hey, come on now, Faust....."
1900,Rutile,Is he an acquaintance?
1901,Figaro,"I guess he might be, you know?"
1902,Lennox,....I think I do know him.
1903,Narrator,"Lennox finally breaks his long silence, his expression unchanging. He sets his eyes on Faust and stands from his seat. The leg of his chair catches the tablecloth, which in turn pulls the plates toward the edge of the table; they look like they're about to fall, but Lennox pays no heed."
1904,Lennox,Sir Faust - Central Country's founding hero. I am the wizard Lennox who fought under your command. I have been searching for you.
1905,Mitile,Really!?
1906,Rutile,Really!?
1907,Narrator,"The brothers exclaim in surprise as they lean forward to catch the plates, inches from the ground. Lennox comes to his senses and turns around."
1908,Lennox,....Thank you for catching the plates. But why are you so surprised?
1909,Mitile,Because we thought you were just a normal shepherd until yesterday. And now you're an weathered warrior and all.....
1910,Rutile,And you were searching for someone all this time? Why didn't you tell us? You could've talked to us about it.
1911,Narrator,"Faust, on the other hand, immediately looks disgusted."
1912,Faust,.....You've got the wrong man.
1913,Lennox,Sir Faust.....
1914,Narrator,"Before Lennox can press him further, the twins interrupt with a sigh."
1915,Snow,"Goodness gracious, everyone here seems to be tangled up in connections."
1916,White,It looks like this year's < Great Catastrophe > will be just as troublesome.
1917,Faust,.............
1918,Lennox,...........
1919,Heathcliff,..........
1920,Shino,............
1921,Snow,"Lastly, we'll introduce the Northern wizards: I'm Snow."
1922,White,"I'm the Northern wizard, White. The two of us make one."
1923,Snow,We'll introduce the remaining three.
1924,White,Bradley - absent.
1925,Snow,Owen - absent.
1926,White,Mithra - also absent. That's all.
1927,Rutile,Are the Northern wizards busy......?
1928,Snow,You could say they are......
1929,White,You could also say they're not......
1930,Mitile,"......There's no way the Northern wizards will work with us...... Everyone hates wizards because they do bad things. Don't you agree, Sir Sage?"
1931,Narrator,"Mitile asking for my opinion makes me flustered. Snow, White, and Bradley are all Northern wizards. I don't know anything about this world, so- I can't say that they're at fault for sure."
1932,Akira,"Rather than pointing fingers...... How about we try to figure out what we can accomplish together, and work on that instead? Cain mentioned it earlier, but if we can all live here together...... I'm sorry for making it all about myself, but I like the idea. It makes me happy because I have nowhere else to go...... It would be a relief if I could stay in the company of people that I trust."
1933,Nero,Trust......? You're talking about us?
1934,Akira,Yes......
1935,Nero,Why would you trust us?
1936,Akira,Well...... You all seem to say whatever you want...... So I don't feel like anyone's lying......
1937,Nero,............
1938,Akira,"The Northern wizards seem like a scary bunch, but...... It'd be nice if we could get along in time....... Stealing eyeballs and causing mental breakdowns; getting murdered by beasts...... It all sounds pretty scary, but......"
1939,Cain,"If we want the Northern wizards to cooperate, we're going to need Oz's help. He doesn't like being friendly with others, but he's not an unnecessarily aggressive person. If we can get Oz, the strongest wizard, to keep everyone in line, I'm sure the Northern wizards will listen to him, and the people will feel at ease. Don't you agree, Prince Arthur?"
1940,Arthur,"That's true....... It might place a burden on Sir Oz, but...... Having him here would be a relief for everyone."
1941,Figaro,"I feel the same way. I'm speaking as a newcomer here, but the last < Great Catastrophe > was unlike any of the attacks that came before. If it was strong enough to turn ten wizards to stone this time, the next < Great Catastrophe > might be even more powerful. All of the wizards - not just from the North, but also Central, West, East, and South - have to work together to stand up to it."
1942,Arthur,It's just as Sir Figaro says. Sir Sage......
1943,Akira,Yes.
1944,Arthur,"I'm thinking of holding a series of events for the Sage and his wizards: victory parades, parties, and of course, the inauguration ceremony. If we can gather all twenty-one wizards in the capital for that, it'll help to put the people at ease after the disasters they've suffered through. And if we can show that even the Northern wizards, who everyone sees as a threat, are loyal to you, Sir Sage...... I believe we can prevent any more unnecessary commotion like what happened tonight, because people fear wizards. For that reason, I'd like to go persuade Sir Oz to help us, but...... What do you think, Sir Sage?"
1945,Akira,"I agree...... I've only met him once, but Oz seemed reliable. It would be incredibly reassuring if he would take our side. But......"
1946,Arthur,But?
1947,Narrator,I hold my tongue.
1948,Narrator,"What did that passage written in the sage's manual mean, then? ""Prince Arthur is so easy to get along with. Life at the magic headquarters would be so much more enjoyable if he were one of the wizards here."" ""But Oz would probably never allow it. He always disappears whenever Arthur comes to visit, and staunchly refuses to meet him."""
1949,Akira,"......No, it's nothing. Let's go persuade Oz."
1950,Arthur,"Yes. I'll do my best, Sir Sage."
1951,Snow,Then it's decided. That's enough for tonight.
1952,White,All of you can feel free to choose a room to rest in.
1953,Chloe,"I'm glad everyone seems nice! Rustica, I'll go find a room for you."
1954,Rustica,"Thank you, Chloe."
1955,Cain,"I thought we were just going to introduce ourselves, but it basically turned into a meeting. Heath, introduce me to your friend."
1956,Heathcliff,He's not my friend.
1957,Shino,That's my line.
1958,Rutile,Mitile. You shouldn't be so rude.
1959,Mitile,"But...... That guy was so rude...... Um, can I share a room with you, nii-sama?"
1960,Rutile,"There's nothing to be scared of here. You're all grown up now, so you should sleep alone."
1961,Mitile,But......
1962,Rutile,"Don't worry. Father and Mother are watching over you from heaven, Mitile."
1963,Mitile,"....... Ah, Mister Lennox! Can we-...."
1964,Lennox,"Sir Faust, please wait."
1965,Faust,Leave me alone. You've got the wrong man.
1966,Mitile,...... He seems busy......
1967,Riquet,"Mitile, was it?"
1968,Mitile,Ah...... Yes.
1969,Riquet,Shall I take the room next to you?
1970,Mitile,Really?
1971,Riquet,"Yes, gladly. I've been taught to help the small and the weak, after all."
1972,Mitile,I'm not weak! But thank you......
1973,Riquet,Not at all. This is my job as a disciple of God.
1974,Nero,............ Sigh...... I want to go home......
1975,Shylock,Nero.
1976,Nero,Ah...... Yes.......
1977,Shylock,"You're a chef, is that right?"
1978,Nero,"Well, yeah......"
1979,Shylock,Great. Can I leave tomorrow's breakfast preparations to you?
1980,Nero,Well...... Sure...... If it's just breakfast......
1981,Shylock,Thank you. The kitchen is that way. ......Oh? Murr. Are you taking the painting to the kitchen? What are you going to do with it?
1982,Murr,I'm gonna smoke Snow and White!
1983,Snow in the portrait,"Murr, stop it!"
1984,White in the portrait,Don't smoke us!
1985,Narrator,"I listen to their lively conversation as I turn to make my way to my own room. As I do, I notice Arthur pensively standing in the courtyard. I don't really know what's going on between Oz and Arthur. But looking at Arthur makes me hope that we can persuade Oz to come around."
1986,Vincent,......Arthur has been chosen as one of the Sage's wizards?
1987,Soldier,"Yes. It seems like he's been summoned to the magic headquarters! Now that Prince Arthur is one of the chosen wizards, the people must feel more relieved!"
1988,Vincent,......I see. You can leave now.
1989,Soldier,Yes......!
1990,Vincent,"............ I'm not going to let him continue playing the hero - winning over the people's hearts like that. If not for him, I would have been next in line for the throne. Drummond failed to secure the Sage, too...... Since it's come to this, I have no choice but to use the parade and the inauguration ceremony to completely destroy the people's faith in Arthur and the wizards......."
1991,Narrator,"The three Central wizards - Arthur, Cain, Riquet - and I set out to persuade Oz. We gather in front of the elevator in the magic headquarters tower to discuss our strategy."
1992,Cain,"Oz lives in the North, but he's a Central wizard. I think it's better for just the Central wizards to go; he probably wouldn't be too pleased if all of us showed up."
1993,Akira,"If Oz becomes our leader, will the Northern wizards cooperate with us?"
1994,Cain,"Yeah. Because no one can stand up to Oz. The Northern wizards dislike human festivities, so they've never joined the annual parade. The previous sage always got told off for it whenever he visited the Central castle. But if Oz is with us, you should be fine."
1995,Akira,That's a relief to hear.
1996,Arthur,"Even if Sir Oz isn't around, we will protect you, Sir Sage. Cain, how are your eyes?"
1997,Cain,"Yeah. I couldn't see you guys earlier, but I can now."
1998,Riquet,Perhaps you can't see people until you touch them?
1999,Narrator,"At that, the rest of us turn around to look at Riquet."
2000,Riquet,"Just now, our eyes met after I touched him."
2001,Akira,Now that you mention it...... I think that was the case for me as well.
2002,Arthur,Same for me.
2003,Cain,"Now that you mention it, that might be true......."
2004,Arthur,"I'm glad we figured out a solution, Cain."
2005,Cain,"Yeah. It's all thanks to you, Riquet."
2006,Narrator,"Cain's large hand reaches out to casually ruffle Riquet's hair. Riquet shrinks back stiffly, his big eyes widening in surprise."
2007,Riquet,......Please stop. I'm a disciple of God - only those who have committed virtuous deeds are allowed to touch my body.
2008,Cain,"What's this ""disciple of God"" that you speak of?"
2009,Riquet,It means those of us who have this mysterious power. We have been sent by God to grant miracles to His chosen ones.
2010,Arthur,"I've heard of this...... There's a church that refers to wizards as gods and disciples. They don't let wizards out into the world; instead, they keep them confined deep within the church walls and make them go along with their activities. Don't tell me, Riquet......"
2011,Riquet,"The outside world is corrupted. So once this tainted mark on my forehead is erased, I intend to return to the Church."
2012,Narrator,"Cain and Arthur look at each other. Arthur bends down, smiling kindly at Riquet."
2013,Arthur,"The outside world isn't corrupted. Not everything is good and pure, but I believe there are many things that will bring you happiness, Riquet."
2014,Riquet,I don't believe you. I saw people fighting yesterday too. I see how it is - wizards who are ignorant of their roles as disciples of God will lie and try to seduce me to the outside world.
2015,Narrator,"Arthur smiles, a little wryly, as Riquet glares at him."
2016,Arthur,"As long as you're happy, it doesn't matter which world you live in. We won't steal away your happiness. But please, don't decide that this world you know nothing about is an evil one."
2017,Riquet,Why shouldn't I?
2018,Arthur,"Because if you come to despair in your world, there will be nowhere left for you to go. If you make that your only paradise."
2019,Riquet,............
2020,Arthur,"Paradise can exist anywhere. Even if, someday, you come to be abandoned - in time you'll find someone else who needs you. No matter where we go, no matter how we live our lives, know that it's possible for you to find happiness. It's all up to you."
2021,Riquet,......It's up to me......
2022,Cain,"That's right. Plus, I can't see your face unless I touch you. It'd be troublesome if I couldn't do that."
2023,Riquet,Woah...... Please stop touching my head.
2024,Cain,"Ahaha! Sorry, my bad. All right, Sir Sage, Your Highness. Shall we go?"
2025,Arthur,Yes.
2026,Narrator,"Cain inserts a beautiful stone into the stone tablet in front of the elevator, and pulls the lever down."
2027,Cain,We'll take this elevator to the Northern tower.
2028,Akira,It's pretty convenient how you can cross national borders with an elevator.
2029,Cain,The elevator is fueled by mana stones. Mana stones are like fossils which contain magical energy.
2030,Narrator,"The stone casts a faint glow, diminishing slowly like a piece of burning coal before disappearing in a brilliant flash of light."
2031,Riquet,Do you know where in Northern Country we can find Oz?
2032,Arthur,I think Sir Oz is probably in his castle in the North.
2033,Cain,I wonder if we can find it. I hear that it's shrouded in so many layers of illusion that few have ever seen it.
2034,Arthur,I'll be your guide.
2035,Riquet,Have you been there before?
2036,Narrator,"After a brief moment of hesitation, Arthur looks at me and nods imperceptibly."
2037,Arthur,I was raised there.
2038,Narrator,(Elevator dings)
2039,Narrator,"In the elevator, Arthur tells us his story as we make the journey to the Northern tower."
2040,Arthur,"When I was born, the whole country celebrated my birth. But my father and mother kept one thing a secret. -The fact that I was born a wizard. Central Country does not discriminate against wizards, but prejudice against them still remains. Eventually, the truth got out, and...... Rumors spread about my mother being a witch who had tricked my father. My mother took them deeply to heart and grew depressed...... When I was four years old, she ordered a loyal servant to abandon me far away in the Northern mountains."
2041,Riquet,She threw away her own child!? How horrifying......
2042,Arthur,"I don't blame her - she must have felt truly desperate. .....It was a snowy, cold, blizzarding night...... I didn't even understand that I had been abandoned.... I kept crying, because I wanted to return to the castle. Gradually, I grew sleepier and sleepier. Before I knew it, I could no longer feel the cold. I was a child, but I realized that I was going to die. But that was when Sir Oz appeared. He took me home to his castle."
2043,Narrator,"Shaken by Arthur's tale, I try to imagine the scene. Oz, who comes across a young child on the brink of death lying in the snowy mountainside. A freezing, tranquil moment."
2044,Arthur,"He saved my frozen soul, provided me with meals, and gave me a bed to sleep in. He even taught me magic. That was how he raised me until I reached the age of thirteen."
2045,Cain,Oz did......?
2046,Arthur,"Sir Oz is a kind person. People often misunderstand him, but...... An evil man would never save a dying child. It may have been nothing but a whim on his part - but to me, he is my savior, and my master in magic. But when I turned thirteen, people from the Central castle came for me, and...... I haven't seen Sir Oz since then. Not even once; not even after he was summoned to the magic headquarters as a Central wizard........"
2047,Cain,Why? Did you fight before you left?
2048,Arthur,"I don't know...... When my father fell ill, and his servants came searching for me...... Sir Oz didn't say a single word. I thought I would be able to return soon afterwards, but...... ......Perhaps Sir Oz is furious with me? For forgetting his kindness in raising me, and leaving his castle behind......"
2049,Narrator,(Clatter)
2050,Arthur,......It looks like we've arrived. Sorry...... I got carried away talking about myself.
2051,Akira,No...... I'm glad you told us about what happened between you and Oz. I hope you can meet him and speak to him today.
2052,Arthur,"Thank you, Sir Sage."
2053,Narrator,"When we arrive at the Northern tower, we're greeted with a freezing blast of cold air. We exhale snowy white puffs of breath; beyond the window, a world of pure silvery brilliance stretches out in front of our eyes. It is so cold that I can't help but shiver. But the scenery is enchantingly beautiful. So beautiful that I feel like it could suck me in."
2054,Akira,"(The air is so clear...... The snow and the forests smell almost primordial......) (The snowy mountain ranges, the vivid blue sky...... How lovely......)"
2055,Narrator,"Riquet seems to feel the same way. He leans out the window, gazing at the landscape with rapt enchantment."
2056,Riquet,......It's beautiful......
2057,Cain,"You're right...... The weather was miserable the last time I came, but Northern Country is beautiful when the sun's out."
2058,Arthur,"I'm happy to hear that. The North is like a second home to me. Sir Sage. Once we make it over those mountains, there's a lake that's as big as the sea. Beyond that lake, at the peak of a high mountain, is Sir Oz's......"
2059,Riquet,Woah......!
2060,Narrator,"Suddenly, a strong wind sweeps through the air. Cain moves to shield me, one hand going to the hilt of his sword. I know this by now: an unnatural wind marks the presence of a wizard. When the wind subsides, a tall figure stands before us."
2061,Narrator,It's Oz.
2062,Arthur,......Sir Oz......
2063,Oz,What business do you have in these remote lands? Leave.
2064,Narrator,Everyone freezes at Oz's harsh voice. But Arthur still pleads in desperation.
2065,Arthur,"Sir Oz, please hear us out."
2066,Oz,I'm telling you to go home.
2067,Arthur,"Sir Oz, it's me, Arthur. I might have grown taller, but I'm Arthur - the boy you raised."
2068,Oz,...........
2069,Arthur,"I apologize for not even sending a letter after all this time. Please, forgive me for my ingratitude. Even if...... Even if you cannot forgive me, please listen to what they have to say. We would like you to lend us your strength, Sir Oz."
2070,Narrator,"My chest grows warm at the slight quaver in Arthur's voice. Cain seems to be similarly moved; he places his arm around Arthur's shoulders, and calls out to Oz."
2071,Cain,"That's right, Oz. Come to the magic headquarters, and lead us. You're the only one who can. The humans will feel at ease if they realize that you and the Northern wizards are on their side. But leaving that aside, you should forgive Prince Arthur! Hasn't he apologized enough?"
2072,Oz,"This has nothing to do with you, knight from Central."
2073,Cain,It has everything to do with me. He is my lord. And you are my comrade.
2074,Arthur,Cain......
2075,Riquet,Oz! I hear that you're the strongest wizard in the land. Then please tell me how to get rid of this mark. Please release me from this role. I never asked for this!
2076,Narrator,"Riquet pleads with a raised voice. Oz turns both eyes on him, his gaze cold."
2077,Oz,That goes for us all. We are all burdened with roles we never wished for. Do not assume that you alone can escape.
2078,Riquet,............
2079,Oz,Sage. Do not get involved with me. Take them back to the magic headquarters in Central.
2080,Akira,But......
2081,Oz,This is no place for people like you. I've warned you.
2082,Arthur,"Please wait, Sir Oz......!"
2083,Narrator,"Arthur reaches out towards Oz as he turns to leave. In that moment, Oz catches sight of the crest on the back of Arthur's hand...... And for the first time, his expression changes. His eyes widen with a shock akin to despair."
2084,Oz,......Why......
2085,Arthur,"I have also been summoned. I, too, am one of the wizards at the magic headquarters! Just like you, Sir Oz! I am not speaking to you as the prince of Central Country! Please, come with us......!"
2086,Oz,............
2087,Oz,............
2088,Narrator,"Oz vanishes like fallen snow, leaving Arthur's pleas hanging in the air. We are left behind in this beautiful world."
2089,Arthur,......Sir Oz......
2090,Cain,"Please cheer up, Your Highness...... I'm sure you'll make up one day."
2091,Arthur,......Thank you.
2092,Riquet,I can't escape from this role......? ......How am I supposed to tell Father Priest about my disgrace......
2093,Narrator,"The icy cold air sparkles under the vivid blue skies. We've failed to persuade Oz. Arthur's expression as he stands there, silent and still, is so painful that I can't bear to look at it."
2094,Narrator,(Rumble)
2095,Narrator,"Then, the distant sound of rumbling earth."
2096,Riquet,......What is this sound.......? Don't tell me...... It's the roar of some creature.......?
2097,Narrator,"Cain's grim gaze sweeps across the landscape, and he grasps our hands."
2098,Cain,Let's return to the magic headquarters. Right now.
2099,Akira,Y-yes.
2100,Cain,"You too, Prince Arthur."
2101,Arthur,......Ah......
2102,Narrator,"Arthur looks up helplessly, and freezes in his tracks. He gazes intently out the window, his limpid eyes blown wide open. It is impossible to get a clear view out the narrow window, but it looks like a gigantic white creature - so huge it blots out the entire expanse of glittering frost and blue skies. The stomach of the creature writhes and squirms as it ascends. If we could get a closer look, I'm sure it would be bigger than a bullet train...... Bigger even than an oil tanker ship."
2103,Riquet,......Is that a Grand Dragon.......? I thought they had gone extinct in the distant past......?
2104,Narrator,(Roar)
2105,Narrator,"In the next second, a deafening roar resounds throughout the ground. The walls of the Northern tower start to tremble violently, spraying fine grains of crumbling sand."
2106,Cain,"Hurry, to the elevator!"
2107,Riquet,......Got it!
2108,Arthur,"Sir Sage, this way!"
2109,Narrator,"We make a flying leap onto the elevator. Beyond the window, the giant creature flying in the sky notices the tower, and turns to charge towards us. It looms steadily closer with every beat of its wings, as the wind becomes a typhoon so strong that we stagger under its force."
2110,Cain,"Move, move, move......!"
2111,Narrator,"The creature is so huge that it could very well knock down the Northern tower simply by crashing into it. Arthur shields me, and I grip Riquet's hand tightly as I look out the window beyond the elevator doors. The last thing we see is - the gigantic creature's jaw and fangs gaping wide open. And then...... A shadow appears, standing between the tower and the creature, as if protecting us from it."
2112,Narrator,"It was only for a split second - it might have been my imagination. Maybe nobody else noticed. Not even Arthur, who had been protecting me. But I was certain that I saw him."
2113,Akira,(......Oz......!?)
2114,Narrator,Oz raises his staff towards the sky. And the doors of the elevator close.
2115,Riquet,......That surprised me......
2116,Cain,"That wasn't my imagination, right...... Did you guys see it too?"
2117,Arthur,"Yes....... That was indeed a Grand Dragon, like the ones I've seen illustrated in books......"
2118,Riquet,I thought unicorns were the only creatures who could wield magic like us?
2119,Cain,To think that even the Grand Dragon would come back to life...... Was this also caused by the < Great Catastrophe >......?
2120,Narrator,"The wizards turn pale; even to them, that gigantic creature was a fearsome existence."
2121,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2122,Narrator,That's when Shino approaches us.
2123,Shino,"Looks like you ran into a monster. I saw one in the Eastern forest, too."
2124,Cain,The Eastern forest? Do you mean Sherwood Forest?
2125,Shino,Yeah. I ran into a wyvern. It was a tough opponent.
2126,Cain,You defeated it?
2127,Shino,Yeah.
2128,Cain,You're amazing!
2129,Narrator,Shino looks a bit pleased at Cain's praise.
2130,Shino,"Well, yeah."
2131,Arthur,"......I need to report this to the ministers...... Sorry, I'll have to return to the castle for a bit."
2132,Cain,Understood. Shall we postpone the parade and the inauguration ceremony?
2133,Arthur,"No, we'll hold them as planned. We need to offer the people hope after the suffering they went through under the < Great Catastrophe >. I'm sorry that I keep asking for you to lend me your strength, but please work with me."
2134,Akira,Yes.
2135,Cain,Gladly.
2136,Riquet,......I understand.
2137,Shino,"A parade and a party? Do I get anything for participating? Can I become someone of status, like the Master of Blanchett?"
2138,Arthur,You can become a hero. Everyone will look forward to witnessing your great deeds.
2139,Narrator,Shino raises his eyebrow and grins.
2140,Shino,"A hero, huh. Not bad."
2141,Cain,You're an interesting one. Eastern wizards are supposed to hate humans and attention.
2142,Shino,There's something that I want.
2143,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2144,Narrator,"Shino answers shortly, and then walks away. Arthur, too, leaves for the Central castle. His face bore a despondent expression before he left; I don't think the appearance of the gigantic creature was solely to blame. Of course he's sad. Because Oz - the man who raised him - treated him with such harsh coldness."
2145,Akira,"(It's probably better if I don't tell him about seeing Oz at that last moment...... I might be wrong, and I don't want him to worry.) (I hope Oz is safe..... It'd be good if they could make up.) (Since Arthur is feeling so down...... I have to work harder to make the party and parade a success.)"
2146,Central Country woman,I hear that the Sage and the wizards are coming to the capital!
2147,Central Country man,"It's the parade they hold every year after they've held off the attacks of the < Great Catastrophe >! There'll be an inauguration ceremony too, since we have a new Sage and new wizards! Finally, some good news......"
2148,???,............ A new sage......
2149,Cain,"Oz and the Northern wizards are still missing, but we should follow Arthur's lead and head over to the Central capital. Everyone should get ready to travel....."
2150,Akira,Yes.
2151,Chloe,Sir Sage! Sir Sage! I have a guest for you!
2152,Akira,A guest?
2153,Envoy,"I-I'm an envoy from the capital, with a message from Prince Arthur: preparations for the parade are still underway, so he would like you to wait here for a while longer."
2154,Cain,"I see. The capital must be in disarray, after all."
2155,Akira,"When should we depart, then?"
2156,Envoy,"Tomorrow, or the day after.... We will send another envoy your way when preparations are complete. Until then, do relax and spend the time as you please."
2157,Akira,"I see. Thank you. I guess we should wait at the magic headquarters for a while, then."
2158,Akira,"A parade and a party, huh.... I've only ever been to a relative's wedding party - what am I going to do about etiquette....?"
2159,Narrator,(Knock knock)
2160,Chloe,"Sir Sage, can I come on in?"
2161,Akira,"Chloe? Yes, of course."
2162,Narrator,(Door opens)
2163,Chloe,Excuse me. Can I ask a question?
2164,Akira,What is it?
2165,Chloe,"Arthur mentioned stuff like a parade and a party and a ceremony, but do we get to participate in all that too?"
2166,Akira,Yes. They'll all be held in Central Country.
2167,Chloe,Yay~!
2168,Narrator,Chloe raises both his arms and leaps up in delight.
2169,Chloe,"I've always wanted to go to a party! I've made clothes for parties before, but I've never actually been to one! Yay! I'm so so happy! I love designing clothes! What kinds of clothes should I make this time?"
2170,Narrator,Chloe spins around and around in a dance of joy. I can't help but smile watching him.
2171,Akira,Seeing you this delighted makes me happy too.
2172,Chloe,"Of course I'm happy - it's a party! Don't you like parties, Sir Sage?"
2173,Akira,"I've never really been to one, you see....."
2174,Chloe,"Then we're the same! I'll make you an awesome outfit, Sir Sage. I'm making one for Rustica too. Rustica is tall and handsome, so he looks good in everything. But getting him into the outfit is the hard part! He does his buttons up all wrong, and his laces are always coming untied. He's clumsy in the weirdest ways, so it can be a whole chore."
2175,Narrator,"Chloe calls it a chore, but it looks like he really enjoys taking care of Rustica."
2176,Akira,"So you and Rustica are pretty close, Chloe."
2177,Chloe,"Hmm, yeah. I guess so? I hope that's the case, but Rustica is a bit quirky, so..... Rustica is actually a noble, you see. He's also a famous harpsichord player. He said he's been to parties before. He told me to watch out because parties will make your eyes spin."
2178,Akira,Make your eyes spin?
2179,Chloe,"They'll spin from looking around at all the people, they'll spin from all the twirling you do as you dance, and they'll spin when you've had too much wine, too."
2180,Akira,Ahaha!
2181,Narrator,I laugh at the silly advice. And Chloe's smile grows even bigger.
2182,Chloe,"You laughed! I'm glad. Sir Sage, you said you came here from another world all alone, right? I was alone until I met Rustica, so.... Let's get along. I'll work hard so that I can be of use to you, Sir Sage!"
2183,Narrator,"Chloe flashes me a big, bright smile of encouragement. His kindness touches my heart."
2184,Akira,"Thank you very much, Chloe. Let's all enjoy the party together."
2185,Chloe,Yeah!
2186,Rustica,"Chloe~? Chloe, where are you?"
2187,Chloe,"Ah, Rustica's calling for me. I bet he lost something again. I have to go. See you later, Sir Sage!"
2188,Akira,See you.
2189,Narrator,"Some are looking forward to the party; others, not so much."
2190,Akira,"The bread is delicious.... Nero, did you bake this?"
2191,Nero,Yeah.
2192,Akira,"It's so good! The wheat flavor is delicious, and the outer layer is crisp, but it's perfectly soft underneath...."
2193,Nero,Thanks.
2194,Akira,Bradley would be delighted. I hear he loves delicious food.
2195,Nero,"Is that so. Hey, Mister Sage. Can I go home already?"
2196,Akira,"I'm sorry.... We can discuss living arrangements later, but I still want you to take part in the party and the parade."
2197,Nero,A party and a parade..... Do I really have to go?
2198,Akira,"You don't want to, Nero?"
2199,Nero,Not really......
2200,Akira,But you ran a restaurant - you must be used to dealing with people?
2201,Nero,"I presented myself as a human when I ran my shop. Only wizards or severe weirdos would visit a wizard's restaurant. The moment you say you're a wizard, people will admire you, hate you, suspect you, avoid you, or fear you. I'm sick of it."
2202,Akira,Nero........
2203,Nero,"I get that you and Arthur are working hard for the sake of wizards, but..... Nothing's gonna change. What you should really do is pretend that you're not a wizard, and just like that, you'll be free of all your burdens."
2204,Riquet,So you never intend on using your God-granted powers for the sake of others? You're just going to selfishly live an easy life?
2205,Akira,Riquet......
2206,Nero,"Haha.... Those are some harsh words first thing in the morning. Good morning, little guy from Central. What do you want for breakfast?"
2207,Riquet,I cannot eat soiled foods.
2208,Nero,What? I'd never feed you any rotten crap. Are you saying I don't keep the kitchen clean?
2209,Riquet,"No, that's not..... I can only eat holy beans, holy milk, holy eggs, and fruit."
2210,Nero,What are you talking about.... Can you draw me a picture?
2211,Riquet,"......Red things, like this..... Yellow things, like this......"
2212,Nero,"Okay, so a banana and an apple. You're a kid, so you need to get more nutrients. How about carbs? Can you eat bread?"
2213,Riquet,I can eat bread.
2214,Nero,Got it.
2215,Narrator,"Without a hint of magic, Nero skillfully gathers the kitchen utensils to begin cooking. A pleasant rhythm fills the kitchen. He handles the pan with such grace that I feel like I'm watching a musician or a dancer; it fills my heart with excitement."
2216,Nero,"Here, thanks for waiting. The bread is fresh out of the oven, so it's still warm."
2217,Riquet,........
2218,Nero,What's wrong?
2219,Riquet,I've never eaten warm food.....
2220,Nero,Huh? What kind of life have you been living? Were you being bullied?
2221,Riquet,No. They took good care of me.
2222,Nero,"I see. But if I cared about someone, I'd never offer them a cold meal."
2223,Riquet,Thank you for the meal.
2224,Nero,"Yeah, eat up. In any case, I refuse to attend the party or the parade......"
2225,Riquet,....It's delicious......
2226,Nero,"Hm? Haha, right? Doesn't it taste great?"
2227,Riquet,......I've never eaten anything so good.......
2228,Nero,.........
2229,Riquet,"It feels like my mouth is in heaven..... It's truly delicious. Thank you so much, Nero."
2230,Nero,........ You're welcome.
2231,Riquet,....This is good too! I didn't realize the outside world had such delicious food..... Ah..... But is this temptation....?
2232,Nero,Temptation? What are you talking about?
2233,Riquet,Father Priest told me that the outside world is corrupted and full of temptation - that's why both humans and wizards have fallen. That is why the Church is protecting me from the outside world until my powers can be put to proper use. I need to erase this tainted mark from my forehead and return to my people at the Church as soon as possible....
2234,Nero,Who is this father priest? Is he a wizard?
2235,Riquet,"No. He's human, but he was chosen by God - he can hear His voice. He taught me my way of life."
2236,Nero,"............. ...Humans are even using kids now, huh....."
2237,Riquet,Huh?
2238,Nero,How old are you?
2239,Riquet,I'm sixteen.
2240,Nero,You seem younger than that..... Must be because you were locked away all this time....
2241,Riquet,I wasn't locked away. They were simply protecting me from the corruption of the outside world. They're all very kind people.
2242,Nero,"......Got it. Feel free to eat as much as you want. There's plenty to go around for seconds, too."
2243,Riquet,"Yes, thank you!"
2244,Mitile,Riquet!
2245,Riquet,Mitile.....
2246,Mitile,"Ah... Hello Sir Sage. Mister Nero, too - breakfast was delicious!"
2247,Nero,Thanks.
2248,Mitile,"Riquet, when you're finished eating, let's head to the courtyard together. My brother will be teaching lessons!"
2249,Riquet,Rutile will? Am I allowed to join you?
2250,Mitile,"Of course! We're friends now, Riquet."
2251,Riquet,Friends..... Got it. I'll join you then.
2252,Mitile,"Ah.... Sir Sage, Mister Nero, would you like to join us too?"
2253,Nero,"I'm good. Study hard, guys."
2254,Akira,I'll drop by to see how things are going later.
2255,Mitile,All right. See you later!
2256,Riquet,Ye~s!
2257,Narrator,Riquet and Mitile exchange smiles. The hint of childishness in their interactions warms my heart.
2258,Rutile,"All right now, Mitile, Riquet. I'm going to teach you two some new words today."
2259,Mitile & Riquet,Yes!
2260,Rutile,"Riquet, how well can you write?"
2261,Riquet,Write.....
2262,Mitile,Don't you know how to read and write?
2263,Riquet,It wasn't part of my job.... Does everyone here know how to write?
2264,Mitile,"Yes, my brother taught me!"
2265,Riquet,........... .......I see.....
2266,Rutile,"Then let's start by learning how to write your name, Riquet. I love the name Riquet - it has such a beautiful ring to it. How about you, Riquet?"
2267,Riquet,Ah.... I like it too.....
2268,Rutile,"That's great. ""Riquet."" This is how you spell your name."
2269,Riquet,R-i-q-u-e-t......
2270,Rutile,"Well done! Next, Mitile, could you write your name? Make it look extra nice, so that Riquet can read it."
2271,Mitile,"Got it! Watch me, Riquet. ""Mitile""...... This is my name."
2272,Riquet,M-i-t-i-l-e. Mitile. Got it! I'll try writing it out.
2273,Rutile,"Excellent job, you two. Both humans and wizards use words to express their thoughts and feelings to others, right? That's why words are so important. Words express the heart, and in turn, the heart is also drawn to words. If you use kind words, you become a kinder person. If you use cruel words, you become a crueler person. The words you use will tinge your heart, dyeing it different colors. And the words that you receive can also influence the color of your heart. If you hear nothing but strict and cruel words, your heart shrivels up and becomes all sad and miserable. That's why words are the same as magic. They can bring blessings upon yourself and others, but they can also cast curses the same way."
2274,Riquet,I see......
2275,Riquet,I would like to use words of blessing. Because I want to bless others and make them happy. This includes you two as well.
2276,Rutile,"Thank you. That already makes me happy; you're a kind, good boy, Riquet. And the same goes for Mitile, too. I love you two very much."
2277,Mitile,Ehehe......
2278,Riquet,Ehehe.....
2279,Narrator,Riquet and Mitile blush and giggle to each other.
2280,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2281,Narrator,Nero approaches me as I observe the heartwarming moment. He awkwardly averts his gaze as he mumbles.
2282,Nero,I'll do the party and the parade.
2283,Akira,Eh? Really....?
2284,Nero,"Just this once. None of it is taking place in Eastern Country, so.... If we wizards show up all fancy - looking all tough - for these events, people will be less likely to take advantage of laid-back guys like them, right?"
2285,Akira,Nero.... Thank you.
2286,Nero,"No need to thank me. It's basically just a free meal and drinks, after all. ...What about the Northern wizards? They're not going to show up, right?"
2287,Akira,"I'd like them to come, but..... They probably won't show up unless someone stronger than them - like Oz - commands them to....."
2288,Nero,"Yeah, that makes sense. ....It's for the better....."
2289,Akira,Nero?
2290,Nero,"No, it's nothing....."
2291,Akira,Rutile.
2292,Rutile,Sir Sage.
2293,Akira,I was listening to your lesson from a distance. Please let me join in next time. I'd love to learn about the world with everyone else.
2294,Rutile,"Giving the Sage a lesson - the prospect makes me nervous, but I'd love to have you!"
2295,Akira,"Rutile, both you and your brother Mitile are wizards, right? Were your parents wizards too?"
2296,Rutile,"Our father was human, but our mother was a witch. She was known as the great witch Tiretta, and she was apparently quite famous. She passed away after she gave birth to Mitile, but she was a bright and cheerful witch."
2297,Akira,"I see.... Rutile, you must be a kind person because she was a wonderful mother."
2298,Rutile,"Thank you. Mother was an important person in my life, but it's also thanks to one of her friends."
2299,Akira,Miss Tiretta's friend?
2300,Rutile,"Yes. I met him when Mitile was still in Mother's tummy. I was a child at the time, but he still seemed like such a cool man. Powerful witches and wizards can tell when their life is coming to an end.... When Mother told me that she didn't have much time left.... I fell into shock, and almost started crying. But her friend showed me an incredible spell: it was so powerful that he blew away an entire mountain in an instant."
2301,Akira,A whole mountain in an instant.... I didn't realize magic could be so powerful.....
2302,Rutile,"Yes. After that, the cool uncle gave me a weird talisman and promised me this: ""I will protect you and your brother."""
2303,Narrator,Rutile smiles bashfully.
2304,Rutile,"Those words really heartened me. Because I knew that I wouldn't be alone, even after Mother died. And he was right - my little brother was born. Then my mother passed away, and my father followed, leaving just the two of us behind..... But knowing that we have this uncle watching over us.... That alone reassures me, and I can keep walking forward with my head held high, telling myself, ""hang in there, and keep doing your best."""
2305,Rutile,"Long legs? Now that you mention it, he did have long legs! Mother introduced him to us as an uncle, but he actually looked a bit younger than that. Ah! I got carried away chatting for so long. It just brought back all these memories....."
2306,Akira,"No, thank you for telling me all this. I hope you get to meet your Daddy Long Legs one day."
2307,Rutile,Me too!
2308,Central Country man,Today's the day of the Sage's wizards' parade! We'll get to see the heroes who defeated the < Great Catastrophe >!
2309,Central Country woman,The wizards sure are taking their time......
2310,Central Country man,"Even if you call them heroes, wizards are just liars who only act according to their whims. Are you sure they didn't just ditch?"
2311,Central Country woman,No way...... But we put so much effort into preparing for their welcome on top of carrying out the restoration work.......
2312,Central Country man,"They must have been this irresponsible when fighting against the < Great Catastrophe > too...... That's why we've suffered such great damages...... .....Even though we suffered as much as they did, why are we the ones who have to welcome them......"
2313,Arthur,............ Everyone is late.......
2314,Cock Robin,Indeed......
2315,Arthur,We were supposed to meet up at the outskirts of town and head to the parade together. I explained all this to Cain. It's already time...... Did something happen? Maybe I should go and check.
2316,Cock Robin,"Y-you can't! Prince Arthur, if you're gone too-...."
2317,Arthur,"Then could you go check on them for me, Cock Robin?"
2318,Cock Robin,"I understand. If I hurry by carriage, I'll be there in half a day -"
2319,Arthur,"No, that'd be too late. If you fly at the speed of a frigate bird, you should be there in no time."
2320,Cock Robin,"Well, sure, but I'm not a frigate bird...... ......!?"
2321,Arthur,<< Pernoctant Nixzo >>
2322,Narrator,(Wings flapping)
2323,Cock Robin,"Squawk, squawk squawk squawk!?"
2324,Arthur,"I'm counting on you, Cock Robin."
2325,Cock Robin,Squawk......squawk squawk!
2326,Heathcliff,Your nails....? You paint your nails?
2327,Chloe,"Yup, isn't it cute? I'll paint yours too, Heath!"
2328,Heathcliff,"Uh, umm....?"
2329,Shylock,"It's actually quite sensible to decorate your fingertips. We cast spells with our fingers when we're not using our magic tools, after all. Putting effort into them will increase your power."
2330,Chloe,"Really! Okay then, I'm gonna make them even fancier..... Woah....!"
2331,Little sheep,"Baa, baa! Baa!"
2332,Riquet,Woah... Such tiny sheep!
2333,Mitile,Aren't Mister Leno's sheep so cute?
2334,Lennox,"I didn't know when we'd get to go home, so I made them small and brought them with me."
2335,Figaro,"Yawn.... It's been a while since I've had this much free time. Rutile, can you brew me some tea?"
2336,Rutile,"Dr. Figaro, you're going to get as round as a cow if you laze around all day."
2337,Figaro,"Hey, cows are great."
2338,Akira,"We were told to wait until another envoy came for us, so....."
2339,Cock Robin,"Grr-, squawk squawk!!"
2340,Chloe,"Woah, what now!? A frigate bird!?"
2341,Heathcliff,No... It's a person.....
2342,Figaro,Looks like he's under a spell. Here we go!
2343,Cock Robin,........hh.
2344,Akira,Mister Cock Robin.
2345,Cock Robin,Sir Sage! Why are you all just sitting around like this!?
2346,Akira,Huh? But we were told to wait here......
2347,Cock Robin,The parade's going to begin any moment now!
2348,Chloe,"Oh no, oh no, we need to hurry! I need to pack this and that and..... Oh, Rustica, are you all packed?"
2349,Rustica,"Yaawn.... Good morning. Why the rush, Chloe? There's still plenty of time till the party. I slept so well. Looks like it's time for some afternoon tea. Let me boil some water and....."
2350,Chloe,Save the tea for later! There was some kind of miscommunication - we need to hurry and leave right now!
2351,Rustica,Really. This is the first time I've heard about that.
2352,Chloe,"Because this is the first time I've mentioned it! Ah, your bedhead.....! Rustica, stay still, I'm gonna fix you up."
2353,Rustica,"Yaawn.... Okay, I'll pack my bag with magic. Some socks, a handkerchief, an umbrella....."
2354,Chloe,"Rustica, that's not an umbrella! That's some snake that was crawling around....!"
2355,Rustica,A necktie?
2356,Chloe,A snake....!
2357,Shino,"Can't they make up their minds? First they tell us to wait, then they tell us to come. What a fuss."
2358,Heathcliff,Look.... They probably have their reasons.
2359,Cain,"I'll lead you guys to the capital by broom. Cock Robin, give me the detailed rundown."
2360,Cock Robin,"Uh, umm, we're going to meet with Prince Arthur at the entrance of the city. Then we'll have you transfer over to the ceremonial carriages for the parade. There will be a crowd of people hoping to see you as the carriages make their way to the castle. If you could wave at them...."
2361,Cain,Got it. Let's go! Everyone follow me!
2362,Murr,There he goes.
2363,Shylock,Cain certainly enjoys leaping ahead and grabbing the reins - perhaps it's because he was the former general of the knights. Let's follow his lead.
2364,Cock Robin,"Ah, wait for me! What should I do.....!?"
2365,Figaro,"You can take the elevator. The headquarters' tower connects to the Central tower, right?"
2366,Snow,Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be functioning. Something might have happened to the Central tower.
2367,Rutile,"Then I can take you. I'll make sure you don't fall, so please hop onto the back of my broom."
2368,Cock Robin,Th-thank you! I'd feel perfectly comfortable riding behind a wizard as kind as you!
2369,Rutile,Leave it to me! I'll fly even faster than a frigate bird!
2370,Cock Robin,Huh?
2371,Figaro,"Hey, good luck. Rutile is usually very calm and gentle, but he's an absolute speed demon when he's flying."
2372,Cock Robin,Huh!?
2373,Rutile,Here we go~.
2374,Cock Robin,W-wai..... Aaaaaahhh......!
2375,Narrator,"The moment Cock Robin mounts the broom, Rutile shoots up into the air. They zip through the sky like a shooting star."
2376,Cock Robin,"Y-you're going too fast! Too fast.....!! Wait, please slow down.....!"
2377,Rutile,Huh? I can't really hear you~.
2378,Akira,W-will he be all right.....
2379,Lennox,I think he'll be fine. Rutile is flying slower than usual.
2380,Rustica,"Sir Sage, allow me to fly you there. May I take your hand?"
2381,Akira,"Ah.... Thank you, Rustica."
2382,Rustica,It's an honor.
2383,Narrator,"Rustica takes my hand and bows with the grace of a prince. He's the second wizard who's let me ride his broom, after Murr. Rustica has me sit in front of him, then wraps his arms around me from behind."
2384,Rustica,"Do excuse me. I know there are people who have their guests ride behind them, but I tend to be a bit careless, so. I'm always afraid that I might lose the person riding with me. So please bear with me for the course of this short flight."
2385,Narrator,I was growing a bit nervous at how close he was - speaking right into my ear - but his gentle and relaxing presence puts me at ease. The soft scent of his refined perfume brightens my mood.
2386,Akira,"Oh, it's fine. Thank you for letting me ride on your broom. Are you sure I'm not too heavy?"
2387,Rustica,"Not at all. I feel like I'm carrying a feather. Well then, shall we go? It might be a bit shaky at first, but we'll be flying steady soon enough. So please don't be afraid."
2388,Narrator,"Rustica's broom floats into the air, and I can feel the tips of my toes leave the ground."
2389,Narrator,(Whoosh)
2390,Narrator,"I realize that each wizard's personality is reflected in how they ride their broom. Murr's flight was a complete mess - a rollercoaster of a ride - but Rustica flies with a delicate, gentlemanly grace. I can see why Chloe is so attached to him."
2391,Rustica,Is the wind too chilly?
2392,Akira,"No, I'm all right."
2393,Rustica,"Sir Sage, how was the weather back in your country? Was it a cold place? Or was it quite warm?"
2394,Akira,"Well.... It was neither extremely hot nor extremely cold. It would get moderately warm, and moderately cold."
2395,Rustica,"That's wonderful. So you could have different experiences while living in one place. That means you're familiar with the flower that blooms in the gentle sunlight, the bright sky that glitters in scorching weather, and the snow that falls upon a freezing night."
2396,Akira,"Yes.... When you put it like that, I guess I am."
2397,Rustica,"Your country, and your life there - it all sounds like a beautiful poem."
2398,Narrator,"My heart grows warm at Rustica's straightforward praise. As I gaze at the vast, sprawling lands beneath us, I'm overcome by nostalgia for my world. I had forgotten about it because of how busy I was, but I loved that world and its four seasons."
2399,Akira,"Yes, it was.... I mean, my world had its problems too, but I still think it was a lovely place. And I like this world too. Day by day, I'm coming to like it more and more. It's mysterious, and beautiful, and a little scary....."
2400,Rustica,"That's wonderful. I'm happy to hear that, and I think this world would feel the same."
2401,Narrator,"A gentle wind blows through the sky and the earth. But as we fly on, the vast and beautiful landscape that had been flourishing with nature slowly begins to reveal the cruel scars of destruction."
2402,Mitile,There was a landslide over there.....
2403,Riquet,And there's a giant crack in the ground over there. Was there an earthquake?
2404,Lennox,How terrible... Catastrophes have left their scars across the land.....
2405,Cain,It must be because the < Great Catastrophe > got so close.... Prince Arthur said the Central capital was in terrible shape as well.
2406,Shino,The Eastern forest was a mess too.
2407,Heathcliff,Does that mean Blanchett Castle....?
2408,Shino,No. The castle region seemed to be relatively well-off. The forest must have protected it. Master and Mistress are both safe.
2409,Heathcliff,I see......
2410,Shino,"But magical creatures from the ancient past have been revived. For humans, it must feel like the end of the world."
2411,Figaro,I see. So that's why they need a hero.
2412,Rutile,....What do you mean?
2413,Cock Robin,Mister Rutile! Please don't make such a sharp turn!
2414,Figaro,"When the world is on the brink of despair, people yearn for heroes - for symbols of hope. But this will be a bit of a dangerous gamble."
2415,Chloe,A dangerous gamble? Why is it dangerous?
2416,Faust,Hmph. Because a hero can easily be transformed into a villain. There may be people who believe that we will save the world- But there are just as many who will claim that we will let the world fall to destruction because we are not strong enough. That's just how humans are.
2417,Shylock,Oh my. So that means we don't know whether the crowd will toss flowers or hurl stones at us during the parade.
2418,Akira,Oh no.....
2419,Chloe,"Eh....? I finally get to participate in a party and a parade, but everyone's just going to hate me again....?"
2420,Rustica,"Nobody will hate you, Chloe. They're all eagerly looking forward to meeting you."
2421,Chloe,But......
2422,Rustica,"Don't you agree, Sir Snow, Sir White?"
2423,Snow & White,"That's right, that's right! ....Is what we'd like to say, but......."
2424,Snow,Faust has good reason to worry. That was why we wanted to get Oz to bring Mithra and the others along.
2425,White,"Because humans fear Oz and the Northern wizards the most. If people see that even these wizards are with us, they'll surely feel at ease, but..... If they see that these wizards refuse to listen to us, it will simply compound their anxiety. For we won't look like we're working together."
2426,Chloe,But.... Does that mean that dressing up is pointless....? Nobody will welcome us...?
2427,Cain,"We just need to look confident, no matter the circumstances. There's no use in getting hung up on the fact that we failed to convince Oz. Plus, I bet Prince Arthur made extra preparations to make up for who we're missing."
2428,Riquet,"Indeed.... If we show the people that we are truly here to serve them as disciples of God, I am sure it will put their worries to rest."
2429,Shino,"What do you mean, serve? We're not slaves."
2430,Heathcliff,Shino......
2431,Shino,We were chosen for a role that we never asked for. Why do we have to suck up to people on top of that?
2432,Riquet,Isn't it simply right to use your God-granted powers for the greater good?
2433,Shino,"Who I choose to be of use to is a decision for me alone. I'm willing to sacrifice my life for my Master and Mistress at Blanchett. But if anyone else wants to use my power, they'd better beg me for it. I refuse to kiss up to a bunch of jerks who sit around and whine all day."
2434,Riquet,"....You are thinking like an oppressor. We are more fortunate than humans, and must....."
2435,Nero,"What do you mean, fortunate? They're out here throwing rocks at us. What do we get from fighting the < Great Catastrophe >? What do we get from fighting public criticism? Absolutely nothing."
2436,Rutile,"Please calm down, everyone.... Even so, I'm sure we can become a symbol of hope for somebody out there - just by existing. Once they remember what it feels like to hope, peace will return to their hearts. And they will no longer reach for rocks to hurl at us."
2437,Faust,How naive.
2438,Rutile,Mister Faust.....
2439,Faust,"Humans possessed by fear will easily carry out more horrifying cruelties than the most vicious wizard in the world. What if the crowd turns into a violent mob? What if they attempt to trample your brother to death? What will you do then, wizard of the South?"
2440,Rutile,I.....
2441,Figaro,I'll protect him.
2442,Rutile,Dr. Figaro.....
2443,Figaro,"And I will also protect you from the stones they hurl, Faust. Because I can smile in the face of such cruelty."
2444,Faust,...........
2445,Figaro,"I understand why you loathe humans. But at this rate, they'll simply see wizards as their enemies. We need to put smiles on our faces to make up for the Oz and the missing Northern wizards. Otherwise, we won't even be able to fight the catastrophes."
2446,Faust,Are you telling me to force a smile!?
2447,Figaro,Listen.....
2448,Lennox,I'll do it.
2449,Narrator,Everyone grows silent at Lennox's words.
2450,Lennox,"I will smile in your stead, Sir Faust, and for the rest of the Eastern wizards too."
2451,Narrator,We all turn around and look at the usually-quiet man with puzzled expressions on our faces.
2452,Mitile,"....You will, Mister Lennox?"
2453,Lennox,Yes.
2454,Mitile,"You're going to force a smile....? Um, I don't think I've really seen you smile all that much, Mister Lennox....."
2455,Lennox,Really?
2456,Mitile,Yes.... Could you please try to smile right now?
2457,Lennox,..........
2458,Lennox,....Like this?
2459,Narrator,"Lennox bares his teeth and grins. And in that moment, the tension among the wizards shatters as they burst into peals of laughter."
2460,Faust,Haha. Now that's certainly not it.
2461,Lennox,....Really?
2462,Figaro,"Ahaha! No no, it was absolutely charming! All the girls in Central will fall in love with you for sure."
2463,Rutile,"Mister Lennox, you're so cute."
2464,Lennox,Am I....?
2465,Shino,"Hey Heath, you should give it a try. You've got a pretty face if nothing else, so you'll have the girls squealing in no time."
2466,Heathcliff,"What do you mean, ""if nothing else""....."
2467,Narrator,I breathe a sigh of relief at the lightened mood in the air. Murr twirls through the bright blue sky with gleeful laughter.
2468,Murr,"Ahaha! How fun! Whether they throw stones or flowers at us - it'll still be fun! We are wizards. We can turn things into anything we want them to be. So let's turn the flowers into fireworks; and the stones into jewels! Let's laugh and carry on, regardless of who is watching us - be it bustling crowds, singing flowers, or pallid ghosts!"
2469,Narrator,"His eyes glimmer with the beauty and terror of a burning moon. I freeze in place, captivated, until Chloe flies up beside me."
2470,Chloe,"Hey, hey, Sir Sage."
2471,Akira,"What is it, Chloe?"
2472,Chloe,"Remember how the twins mentioned that we won't look like we're working together because the Northern wizards are missing? I was actually thinking that it'd be nice if we could wear matching clothes - since it's a party and all. But everyone here is so unique, with all different styles, so I had a hard time coming up with a single uniform. That's why....."
2473,Narrator,"Still on his broom, Chloe pulls out his sewing box and flips open the lid. In an instant, matching robes appear atop all the flying wizards."
2474,Chloe,I made us matching robes and outfits instead!
2475,Rutile,"Oh, these outfits are amazing!"
2476,Shylock,"My, they are quite stylish."
2477,Shino,They look really cool.
2478,Snow,We match!
2479,White,We match!
2480,Snow & White,We love to match!
2481,Chloe,I was wondering if we could wear these during the parade!?
2482,Cain,I think that's a great idea. Uniforms make you feel more disciplined and prepared.
2483,Heathcliff,Reminds me of school.
2484,Figaro,"If you can't afford to spare a smile, how about you at least wear this outfit?"
2485,Faust,No; I'm simply going to wear it because I like it.
2486,Lennox,"Thank you, Chloe."
2487,Rustica,"I'm glad everyone loves your outfits, Chloe."
2488,Chloe,Ehehe.... Yeah!
2489,Murr,Oh! Look! Arthur's flying this way!
2490,Cock Robin,"Your Highness! Please, I told you to wait....!"
2491,Arthur,"I've come to pick you up! I'm glad you're doing well, Sir Sage. The carriage for the parade will be that way - we're all ready to go."
2492,Chloe,I've never seen such a fancy carriage! Amazing!
2493,Rustica,"It looks like this will be quite a joyous parade. Let us head onwards, Sir Sage."
2494,Akira,Yes!
2495,Drummond,"Oh, they made it in time! Lord Vincent, the Sage and the wizards have arrived at the outskirts of town!"
2496,Vincent,............ Is that so.
2497,Drummond,"Goodness, making me all nervous like that...... Where are you headed, Lord Vincent? Will you not be observing the parade?"
2498,Vincent,I will leave the rest to you all.
2499,Drummond,I-I understand!
2500,Soldier,Lord Vincent! We have a problem!
2501,Vincent,What now.
2502,Soldier,"I apologize; this report was delayed due to the parade, but the Central tower......"
2503,Vincent,What......?
2504,Narrator,"The Central Country troops briskly march onwards, as the band plays a cheerful, curious tune. Thus our parade starts, with the soldiers taking the lead. The townspeople gather along the main street, some leaning out of their windows, and wave at us with smiles on their faces."
2505,Narrator,(Cheering)
2506,Central Country man,It's the Sage and his wizards!
2507,Central Country man,The wizards from the magic headquarters who defeated the < Great Catastrophe >!
2508,Central Country man,We have nothing to fear from the < Great Catastrophe > as long as they're around!
2509,Central Country woman,"Thank you, dear wizards......!"
2510,Central Country man,Blessings to the wizards of the magic headquarters!
2511,Narrator,"Confetti and flower petals of every color imaginable swirl and dance against the brilliant blue sky. We wave at the townspeople, relieved by their enthusiastic welcome."
2512,Central Country man,Prince Arthur! Long live Prince Arthur!
2513,Central Country woman,"See, look over there! That's our prince! He saved us that day when the catastrophe struck!"
2514,Arthur,"Thank you, everyone."
2515,Narrator,"Being the prince of Central Country, Arthur naturally gets showered with cheers of encouragement and support from the crowd; the other wizards also receive the same reception."
2516,Central Country man,General Cain! Thanks for your hard work!
2517,Central Country woman,Sir Cain! Come have a drink at my shop again sometime!
2518,Cain,"Sure, thanks!"
2519,Central Country girl,Aahh! What a pretty person!
2520,Central Country girl,"I saw him last year, too! He's the Eastern wizard, Sir Heathcliff!"
2521,Heathcliff,............
2522,Heathcliff,..........
2523,Shino,"Hey, at least wave to them."
2524,Heathcliff,"No, that's too embarrassing....."
2525,Shino,"What is? You should take more pride in yourself. You're a chosen wizard, and a dashing beauty who takes after Mistress. There's nothing embarrassing about you, Heath...."
2526,Central Country girl,And the boy next to him is so tiny and cute!
2527,Shino,Did she just call me tiny?
2528,Heathcliff,"She said you were tiny and cute. You should wave to them, Shino."
2529,Shino,"Don't be silly. Times like these, you're supposed to blow them a kiss with your thumb - like this."
2530,Central Country girl,Aaaaah.....!
2531,Central Country girl,"He's cute, but he's also so cool!"
2532,Central Country girl,I love him too!
2533,Shino,Heh. Did you hear them squeal? The girls from Central sure are cute.
2534,Heathcliff,I guess I could learn a thing or two from you when it comes to your nerves of steel......
2535,Central Country woman,Look at those adorable twins!
2536,Elderly Central Country man,My goodness....! I can't believe children so young are working to save the world.... What admirable wizards they are........
2537,Snow,"Good day, Miss!"
2538,White,"Good day, Mister!"
2539,Central Country woman,Good luck!
2540,Elderly Central Country man,"Don't push yourselves too hard, all right?"
2541,Snow & White,Hee hee! All right!
2542,Figaro,"You're putting on an impressive show, Sir Snow, Sir White."
2543,Mitile,Wow.... The streets are filled with people.....
2544,Rutile,"Right, it's amazing! There are more people here than Mister Leno's sheep."
2545,Lennox,You're counting them like sheep.....?
2546,Faust,"Hey, what happened to putting on a smile?"
2547,Lennox,"Oh, that's right. ....Haha. Good afternoon."
2548,Faust,Fufu. You're terrible at this.
2549,Nero,Sigh..... I'm really not a fan of standing out like this......
2550,Chloe,Really? That kind of Eastern sentiment feels like a waste. I love being the center of attention!
2551,Nero,I don't get how you Western wizards are so cheerful.
2552,Chloe,Everyone has their eyes on me! Everyone's waving at me! I feel like everyone loves me....!
2553,Shylock,"Fufu. You're so adorable, Chloe."
2554,Chloe,"Don't you like all this attention, Shylock?"
2555,Shylock,"My specialty is charming people under the light of the moon, not the sun."
2556,Central Country woman,"Hey, sexy guy from the West! Is it true that Western wizards love to deceive and betray women?"
2557,Shylock,Of course it's true.
2558,Rustica,"Of course not, my dear."
2559,Chloe,"You two are completely different types, but you both know you're sexy....."
2560,Shylock & Rustica,To a certain extent.
2561,Rustica,Hm? Could that person over there be my bride....?
2562,Chloe,"Rustica, please! Not here!"
2563,Rustica,But Chloe.... Mmgh.......
2564,Chloe,"Come on, zip your mouth and wave!"
2565,Rustica,"Mggh..... Ahahaha, good day."
2566,Central Country man,"Good day, good wizards!"
2567,Central Country child,"Hey, Mister Wizard, can you show me some magic?"
2568,Murr,Sure!
2569,Narrator,"Murr stands up in response to the innocent child's request and lifts his hand into the air. When he utters his spell, rainbow-colored lights begin to cluster around the ring on his left hand."
2570,Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
2571,Narrator,"They fly high into the air, bursting across the blue sky. And scatter like fireworks. Surrounded by rubble, the people of the city look up at the bright sky with smiles on their faces."
2572,Central Country child,Wow....!
2573,Central Country man,Amazing.... So this is the miracle of magic....!
2574,Central Country woman,I'm sure they'll protect us from the next < Great Catastrophe >!
2575,Narrator,"The crowd erupts into loud cheers of delight, the people's faces lighting up with smiles all around. My heart wells up with pride; I've only known them for a short while, but it makes me happy to hear so much praise for these people who I've come to think of as friends. But amidst the delighted cheers, I hear somber voices."
2576,Central Country man,"......Who are they trying to fool....... The Northern wizards are the crucial ones, but they aren't even here."
2577,Central Country man,They always just do as they damn well please. Things must have ended up like this because they cut corners during the fight against the < Great Catastrophe >.......
2578,Central Country man,"At this rate, the world's gonna end next year......"
2579,Akira,"............ (......I knew it. Everyone's concerned about the Northern wizards......) (Snow and White are also Northern wizards, but......) (......Where are they...... Bradley, Mithra, and Owen......)"
2580,Riquet,......Ah......
2581,Akira,"What's wrong, Riquet? Do you see a familiar face in the crowd......?"
2582,Follower of the church,............Wizards are meant to be the disciples of God! What a deplorable charade!
2583,Central Country man,"Woah, what's wrong with you, old man! Don't start yelling out of nowhere on such a joyous day......"
2584,Central Country man,He's part of that sketchy cult. Just leave him!
2585,Akira,Riquet?
2586,Riquet,......No...... It's nothing.
2587,Cock Robin,"Great work, everyone! The parade was a huge success! Frankly, I was worried that the crowd might throw stones at you, so it was a relief that everyone was so happy to see you!"
2588,Shino,You really don't have a problem speaking your mind.
2589,Cock Robin,Heheh. The party will be held over in that hall. Please enjoy yourselves!
2590,Shino,"Got it. ...Huh, what's that room over there? Is that taxidermy?"
2591,Heathcliff,"Hey, don't wander around, Shino."
2592,Shino,This place is bigger than Blanchett Castle.
2593,Heathcliff,Of course it is. It's where the King of Central Country resides; naturally it's going to be bigger than some castle way out in the woods.
2594,Shino,"But I like Blanchett Castle more. It's surrounded by the forest and a lake; it's beautiful. If Master and Mistress so desired, I would gladly make Blanchett Castle even bigger."
2595,Heathcliff,Father and Mother simply wish to live peaceful lives; they don't ask for much.
2596,Shino,"But I want to grant them everything wonderful in this world. And I feel the same about you, Heath. But I guess I just made trouble for you."
2597,Heathcliff,"....That's not true. I'm always grateful to you, Shino. Because you might be brusque, but you're always kind. When I fell ill and was stuck in bed all day, or when I was feeling down because my tutor scolded me - you always brought me flowers and squirrels from the forest. I still think of you as my little brother."
2598,Shino,Little brother? You're the little brother.
2599,Heathcliff,"What? No, I think everyone would agree that you're the little brother."
2600,Shino,"No, I definitely take care of you more. So you're the little brother."
2601,Heathcliff,"You're so stubborn. Shino, you-...."
2602,Young Central noble,Heathcliff? Are you Heathcliff from the Blanchett family in the East?
2603,Heathcliff,Ah.....
2604,Young Central noble,"Do you remember me? We met at the testing center of the Aristocrat's Academy. I remembered you because you had the best score in the class - plus, you were so handsome. I didn't realize you were a chosen wizard."
2605,Heathcliff,....Ah. Yeah.
2606,Young Central noble,That's amazing! It's like you were destined to be a hero from the moment you were born. I'm jealous. I'd like to introduce you to my parents later....
2607,Heathcliff,Please stop.
2608,Young Central noble,...Ah... Sorry... I got carried away.
2609,Heathcliff,"....No, it's.... I don't want to stand out too much. Sorry about that......"
2610,Shino,Why? You should go. Let them speak highly of you.
2611,Heathcliff,Shino. This has nothing to do with y....
2612,Shino,"You've got plenty to be proud of: you're a chosen wizard who is as brilliant as Master and as beautiful as Mistress. I am proud to have you as my Lord. But if you can't stop being so ashamed of yourself, then I just look like an idiot."
2613,Heathcliff,"....Shut up. You'd never understand, Shino."
2614,Shino,.......... Is that so. Then keep your eyes on the ground forever.
2615,Heathcliff,.......
2616,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2617,Shino,...........
2618,Akira,"Shino, where are you going? The party hall is in the opposite direction....."
2619,Shino,I'm going home.
2620,Akira,"Oh, I see, you're going ho... Huh!? W-wait! Please wait! He's gone already.... where did he go!?"
2621,Shino,.........
2622,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2623,Akira,"....There he is....! Wait, Shino....!"
2624,Shino,"Woah....! Oh, it's you, Sage. Why'd you jump on me?"
2625,Akira,Because I wouldn't be able to follow you if you flew.... What happened? Why are you suddenly talking about heading home?
2626,Shino,.......... Because I fought with Heath.
2627,Akira,With Heath? Why did you guys fight?
2628,Shino,"Because Heath is ashamed of himself. Whenever Heath is ashamed of himself, I feel like he's ashamed of me, too."
2629,Akira,Why do you say that....?
2630,Shino,.......... ....Why are you asking? Is this part of your job as the Sage?
2631,Akira,"I'm not doing it because it's my job, but..... When I first arrived in this world, Heath was so kind and good to me. And you're so close to him, Shino. That's why I want to know why you're mad. Because you might have a bit of a foul mouth, but you don't seem like a bad person, either....."
2632,Shino,.............
2633,Narrator,"Shino gazes up at me. I can tell from his powerful gaze that he's not pondering over whether to tell me; rather, he's peering into my identity. Like a stray cat that's trying to decide if it should approach you or ignore you and move on. And once those stray cats decide to come close to you, they fear nothing."
2634,Shino,"I'm an orphan. I never knew my parents. But I could use magic, so I never struggled to feed myself. I knew what it was like to be loathed even before I learned the word ""loathe."" I could handle it just fine; it was easy. You just don't wish for friends. So long as you're aware that you'll never belong no matter where you are, you can protect your heart."
2635,He's telling the truth,"Shino doesn't show any signs of hurt as he proudly tells me about his life. But then, his voice grows soft."
2636,Shino,"But stuff happened, and as luck would have it, I was hired by the Blanchett family. Life at Blanchett was heaven. Master, Mistress, and Heath were all so kind and got along so well; they were my ideal family. I had never spoken to them, but I was happy to be of use to them. But one day, Mistress came to speak to me, bringing Heath along with her. She said.... ""Shino, I hear that you're a wizard? Heathcliff is, too."" ""So I hope you and Heath can become friends."" .........."
2637,Narrator,"Then Shino falls silent, as if his heart is filled to the brim. I can't tell why - but I know that his feelings are in turmoil. A painfully pure emotion is suffocating him."
2638,Shino,"......When Mistress asked me to be Heath's friend...... For the first time in my life, I felt like I had a place where I belonged. I felt glad to be a wizard. Because I was a wizard, Mistress had reached out to me, and I would get to be friends with Young Master Heath. I was so happy.... And Heath was delighted too. I swore to myself that I would do anything for this family. ....But lately, Heath has been acting differently."
2639,Akira,What do you mean....?
2640,Shino,He tries to hide the fact that he's a wizard. Because it might start rumors about Master and Mistress.....
2641,Akira,.......
2642,Shino,"There will be stupid naysayers no matter where you go. You just have to ignore them. That's what I keep telling him, but it's impossible for Heath. For me, being a wizard became a source of pride, but for him, it's what brings him shame. He's the son of a noble, so I'm sure he has a lot to deal with. ....I get that, but..... Every time he looks down, I feel like he's trying to keep me hidden. I feel like he's ashamed of me, too. Sage. That's why I want to become a hero. I want to become an incredible wizard who owns a giant castle. One that will immediately captivate anyone who sees it. And once I do, I'll declare myself Heath's friend. Then Heath won't have to feel ashamed of himself, right?"
2643,Akira,Shino........
2644,Narrator,Shino gazes at me with the eyes of a child begging for a rainbow. I laugh and grasp his hand.
2645,Akira,"You're right..... Let's defeat the < Great Catastrophe > and become heroes who save the world. Let's build you a magnificent castle, Shino."
2646,Shino,Can we? Really?
2647,Akira,"I'll do my very best. I'll become an amazing Sage so that everyone will hear out my wishes. But you know... Even without a fancy castle, I think Heath is proud to call you his friend, Shino."
2648,Shino,.........
2649,Narrator,"Shino falls silent. His big eyes, filled with determination, quiver as if he's holding back tears. He grins, and lets out a laugh."
2650,Shino,Thanks for the thoughtful comment.
2651,Akira,You're welcome.... So what will you do about the party?
2652,Shino,I'll go. I hear there's going to be some delicious pie. Though I bet it's no match for the ones that Mistress bakes.
2653,Akira,Do you like pie?
2654,Shino,It's my favorite food.
2655,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2656,Heathcliff,.....Shino!
2657,Narrator,"We turn to see Heathcliff, awkwardly scratching the back of his neck."
2658,Heathcliff,"....The party is about to begin. You should come too, Sir Sage."
2659,Akira,I'll head over right now.
2660,Heathcliff,What were you two talking about?
2661,Shino,"We were bad-mouthing you, Heath."
2662,Heathcliff,Huh!?
2663,Shino,Just kidding. Let's go.
2664,Narrator,"Shino laughs as he grabs Heath's hand and tugs him along. Heath looks worried at first, but gradually, he too breaks out into a smile. I want this world to become a place where they can smile together and be friends forever, without worrying about what anyone else thinks. I find myself wishing for that from the bottom of my heart."
2665,Akira,"(I need to do what I can tonight to help the relationship between wizards and humans.....) (It may not be much, but there has to be something that I can do.)"
2666,Drummond,"....And with that, I would like to conclude my speech. As the Minister of Magical Affairs, I offer well wishes to the heroes who have been tasked with fighting the < Great Catastrophe >..... The Sage and his wizards from the magic headquarters! Please give them a hearty round of applause!"
2667,Narrator,(Applause)
2668,Chloe,"Woah, this is amazing.... There's lots of people in fancy dresses.... And tons of gorgeous sweets, too....!"
2669,Rustica,"Why are you hiding in the corner, Chloe? Come over here."
2670,Chloe,"B-but are you sure they won't yell at me? We're wizards. Remember that time we went to the festival, and....."
2671,Arthur,Wizards are the stars of this party.
2672,Chloe,"Your Highness, Prince Arthur....."
2673,Arthur,"Please just call me Arthur, Chloe. Thank you for preparing such lovely robes for us. I hope you enjoy yourself tonight."
2674,Chloe,".....Thank you, Arthur....! ....Ah, I feel like I'm living a dream! Rustica, let's go see what everyone's doing over there! Oh! Wait, there's something over here, too!"
2675,Rustica,"Ahaha. Sure. You have my thanks, Prince Arthur."
2676,Arthur,The same goes for me.
2677,Chloe,"Hurry, hurry!"
2678,Rustica,"Slow down, you don't have to pull me along."
2679,Arthur,"Haha..... Please enjoy yourselves to the fullest. I hope wizards will extend an invitation to humans, and humans, to wizards; take this opportunity to get to know each other. For tonight shall be a commemorable mixer between humans and wizards-...."
2680,Akira,A-Arthur! I don't think we'd call this a mixer.....!
2681,Arthur,"Really? All right then, it's a commemorable banquet to celebrate new meetings. Cheers!"
2682,Murr,Cheers!
2683,Shylock,Cheers. This champagne is better than last year's.
2684,Murr,Is that a good thing?
2685,Shylock,Very.
2686,Central Country scholar,Good lord! Are you by any chance the great philosopher Murr?
2687,Murr,Meo~w!
2688,Central Country scholar,......!?
2689,Shylock,I'm afraid not. He's just a stray cat.
2690,Nero,"They're using some really good wheat for this bread.... I guess you'd expect no less from the royal kitchen. If he were here, I bet he would've scarfed it all down and made a real mess...."
2691,Faust,Who is he?
2692,Nero,...........
2693,Faust,You're certainly secretive.
2694,Nero,"....You're the last person I want to hear that from. Hey, where are you going?"
2695,Faust,I'm headed out to take a break. My excuse is that I'm still recovering from my injuries.
2696,Nero,"Yeah, sure - you mean you hate parties."
2697,Faust,I mean I hate this castle.
2698,Nero,....?
2699,Central Country noblewoman,You're such an excellent dancer.... I never knew such gentlemanly wizards could exist.....
2700,Rustica,"It's an honor, my beautiful lady."
2701,Central Country noblewoman,Do you by any chance have a wife?
2702,Rustica,"I'm currently searching for her. When I find her, I plan to trap her in my birdcage for eternity."
2703,Central Country noblewoman,"My goodness, even your sense of humor is delightfully passionate....."
2704,Rustica,"Oh, I'm quite serious. Would you like to enter this birdcage as well?"
2705,Chloe,"Rustica! I was looking for you! Come on, we're headed that way!"
2706,Rustica,"....Excuse me, dear lady. I hope to see you again."
2707,Chloe,"Rustica, you're seriously too soft when it comes to women."
2708,Rustica,"Do you still have trouble with them, Chloe?"
2709,Chloe,"Just a bit.... I mean, I know they're not all like my family, but. I love how kind everyone here is! They told me my clothes were fashionable!"
2710,Rustica,That's wonderful.
2711,Rutile,It's so lively and fun. I wish I could've brought my students along.
2712,Lennox,"The parties you held at school were lovely too, Rutile."
2713,Rutile,"Thank you. Ah, that hat is so cute! I wonder if I can recreate it with the fabric we have at school?"
2714,Lennox,You should ask Chloe how to make it.
2715,Rutile,"Yes, I will!"
2716,Cain,"What's wrong, Riquet? Why do you look so gloomy - aren't you excited about the party?"
2717,Riquet,"I can tell that you certainly are, Cain.... There's lipstick on your collar....."
2718,Cain,"No, no, don't get the wrong idea! I just got caught by a rather drunk lady."
2719,Riquet,Really....?
2720,Cain,"Of course. I know how to exercise proper judgment - I'm a knight, after all."
2721,Riquet,Sigh......
2722,Cain,"How about you, Riquet? What's going on?"
2723,Riquet,I think I saw someone from the Church during the parade. ....He was glaring at me.....
2724,Cain,"Oh, so that's what was bothering you? Hey, forget about the church and enjoy the party. Look at all these sweets."
2725,Riquet,What is this..... There's dirt on this street lamp-colored fruit......?
2726,Cain,"It's not dirt, it's chocolate. This is a chocolate-covered orange. Give it a try."
2727,Riquet,..... This dirt is delicious.....!
2728,Cain,"Please, it's not dirt."
2729,Narrator,I smile as I observe everyone having fun at the party.
2730,Akira,I'm glad everyone seems to be having a good time.
2731,Snow,"Indeed, indeed."
2732,White,We're having fun too.
2733,Figaro,"How about you, Sir Sage? Are you enjoying yourself?"
2734,Akira,"Ah, yes. But I'm not really used to this kind of thing....."
2735,Figaro,"Huh, how cute. If you're looking for a little more fun, how about a dance with me?"
2736,Akira,Huh?
2737,Narrator,"I draw back at Figaro's mischievous grin. He's a bit of a mysterious person. The Southern wizards are all modest and pure, but Figaro alone stands out: he's always composed, and he seems strangely powerful. He must know Snow, White, Arthur, and even Faust - yet he tries to keep his connections a secret. He's kind, but enigmatic. Even now, a cold light lies in the depths of his soothing, smiling eyes. I'm overwhelmed as he takes an audible step towards me."
2738,Figaro,"Don't be shy. Whether you're a man, a woman, an elderly person, a dog, or even the catastrophe itself.... I will dance with you as if I am embracing my dearest beloved. And together, we'll share a passionate dream for a fleeting moment.... Doesn't that sound just lovely? How about it? Now, please lend me your hand."
2739,Narrator,"He graciously offers me his hand, but my nerves are still buzzing. Figaro's words are seductive, and his smile, charming - I can tell that he's trying to seem harmless. But there's still something strangely terrifying about him: if I take his hand, I feel like I'm going to get swallowed whole."
2740,Akira,"Ah... No, I think I'll pass....."
2741,Figaro,But why?
2742,Akira,"Ahaha.... I've never danced before, you see. Please feel free to invite someone else."
2743,Figaro,But I want to dance with you.
2744,Akira,....Why....?
2745,Figaro,Because I want to make you my puppet.
2746,Narrator,Figaro replies calmly with a smile.
2747,Figaro,The Sage keeps the wizards in the magic headquarters together. If I want him to do my bidding - don't you think the fastest way to accomplish that would be to make him fall in love with me?
2748,Akira,What....?
2749,Figaro,"Because when you fall in love, you can give up your heart to those you do not trust - and even to those you loathe. I'm asking you to join me in that act. ....How about it? Won't you dance with me?"
2750,Narrator,"I can't believe my ears; he's saying such horrific things in such a kind, sweet voice that it makes my head spin. I stare at Figaro in shock. He's neither making a fool of me, nor is he trying to laugh at me. He just continues smiling with a kind, gentle gaze."
2751,Akira,Is this a wizard's joke....?
2752,Figaro,"Maybe so. Why don't you see for yourself? Whether I'm a man who will hurt you, or a man sweeter than honey. Whether I'm poison or medicine.... You'll find out when you take my hand."
2753,Narrator,"His eyes, deeper than the sea, gaze into me as if soothing a child. I almost reach out in spite of myself. But then......"
2754,Mitile,Dr. Figaro!
2755,Akira,.......!
2756,Figaro,"Oh, Mitile. What is it?"
2757,Narrator,"I snap back to my senses at Mitile's voice. Figaro seems like a completely different person again as he turns around to greet Mitile with a friendly, peaceful smile."
2758,Mitile,"Don't go wandering off on your own like that. I said I'd keep an eye on you so that you wouldn't drink too much, Dr. Figaro. Remember?"
2759,Figaro,That's right. Sorry about that.
2760,Mitile,Were you secretly drinking lots of alcohol?
2761,Figaro,I'm not so ill-mannered. I was just chatting with Sir Sage - isn't that right?
2762,Narrator,Figaro winks at me facetiously. I nod absent-mindedly.
2763,Akira,Ah... Yes....
2764,Mitile,"Geez. You were the one who said you'd drink less as your New Year's resolution, Dr. Figaro."
2765,Figaro,"I know. I won't do anything to make you worry, Mitile."
2766,Mitile,"I'll hold you to your word, okay! You really do need me to keep an eye on you, Dr. Figaro. You have to show everyone how good Southern Country is so that wizards from other countries won't make fun of us."
2767,Figaro,"Ahaha.... I'm not too good at that sort of thing, you know."
2768,Mitile,Geez~! Try harder!
2769,Narrator,"Figaro looks like a hapless father as Mitile takes his hand and drags him away. He's a completely different person from earlier. I'm still stunned, motionless. Next to me stand the two others who were also watching him."
2770,Snow,Scary.....
2771,White,What was that......
2772,Akira,"Snow, White....."
2773,Snow,"I'm sorry, Sage. Figaro doesn't mean to hurt you."
2774,White,He's just a terrible person from his very core......
2775,Akira,Wh... What kind of person.....
2776,Narrator,"Before I can ask any further, a stir of excitement suddenly runs through the crowd."
2777,Central Country man,"It's His Royal Highness, the king's brother!"
2778,Central Country man,Lord Vincent has arrived!
2779,Arthur,......My uncle......
2780,Narrator,"A magnificently-dressed man steps into the room, and the crowd of people bows their heads reverently. Including Arthur. Cain comes to stand next to me, whispering quietly into my ear."
2781,Cain,"That's His Royal Highness, Lord Vincent. He's the king's brother and Prince Arthur's uncle. I can't see him, but you can, right?"
2782,Akira,Yes...... There's a man who everyone is bowing their heads to. That must be him......
2783,Cain,"His Majesty was often ill, so Lord Vincent stepped in to manage the kingdom's affairs until Prince Arthur returned. He's a ruthless pragmatist, so he's tolerant towards people who show talent. But he's relentlessly harsh on those who fall behind or show the slightest hint of incompetence. Rather than rely on the vague uncertainties presented by magic, he prefers magical technology, which he can control with precision."
2784,Akira,Magical technology?
2785,Shylock,"It's an ashen-colored technology born from Western Country, utterly lacking in any sense of beauty."
2786,Narrator,"Before I know it, Shylock has appeared at my side. He draws from his pipe as he raises an eyebrow in a rare show of irritation."
2787,Shylock,Magical technology allows you to generate magic through scientific tools which are fueled by mana stones.
2788,Akira,So humans can use magic too?
2789,Shylock,Yes. Without sacrificing a thing.
2790,Narrator,Shylock blows out smoke from his pipe like a cold sigh.
2791,Shylock,"If you attain comfort without laboring your heart or body, what kind of joy exists in that? I adore all forms of desire. But this - this is so unrefined, idle, and lacking in imagination."
2792,Cain,"You've got an interesting perspective. So you don't hate how it allows humans to use magic, but it goes against your sense of aesthetics."
2793,Shylock,"I am the master of a bar, after all."
2794,Narrator,"Shylock smiles, narrowing his eyes; his gaze settles on us like he's humouring children."
2795,Shylock,"Good wine is seductive. Likewise, temptation lies coiled like a snake inside all the pleasures this world has to offer. Such temptation ensnares the hearts of people, just as powerful magic does. And that is precisely why restraint is so beautiful. Like the agony of a holy man who must turn a deaf ear to the seductive allure of all the beauties in the world - isn't resistance in the face of pleasure the most luscious thing?"
2796,Cain,"......Leaving aside whether I agree with you or not...... When you start talking, this palace ballroom starts to feel like a nighttime lounge......"
2797,Shylock,"The pleasure that arises from releasing your hold on moderation and reason does not bring about the slightest conflict. Without conflict, there is no depth. And without depth, there is no flavor. Magical technology may drive many to a drunken stupor, the same way cheap wine does, but...... One day, it will create the worst hangover that this world has yet experienced."
2798,???:,............
2799,Narrator,"A man glares intently at Shylock, seeming to have overheard his speech. Shylock pays him no attention. At that moment, Arthur approaches Mister Vincent, and they start to exchange courteous greetings."
2800,Arthur,Uncle Vincent. Welcome; thank you for coming today.
2801,Vincent,I see the party is as lively as it is every year. Despite the fact that the wizards failed to defeat the < Great Catastrophe > and caused us such devastating casualties this year.
2802,Arthur,That's......
2803,Vincent,I know; this is a festive occasion. I won't say anything further.
2804,Arthur,......Yes......
2805,Narrator,Arthur bows deeply. The man standing diagonally behind Mister Vincent speaks up in his stead. It's the man who glared at Shylock earlier.
2806,Nicholas,"I belong to the Special Forces Unit of the Magical Technology Division. I am Nicholas, captain of the Magical Technology Corps."
2807,Arthur,"I know. You used to be the general of the Order of Knights, but you went on to study magical technology in Western Country; you only just returned a few months ago."
2808,Nicholas,"Pleased to make your acquaintance. Now that you have our Magical Technology Corps, there should be no foreseeable need of the Sage's wizards."
2809,Narrator,"At Mister Nicholas' words, a stir ripples through the crowd at the party. Quite a few amongst the wizards furrow their brows in displeasure."
2810,Shino,Looks like someone's got a big mouth.
2811,Heathcliff,"Hold it, Shino."
2812,Cain,"Captain Nicholas...... He quit the Order of Knights after he lost to me, but he's been talking big ever since he got his hands on that magical technology."
2813,Shylock,Drunks who have consumed too much cheap wine tend to boast quite loudly.
2814,Narrator,My eyes dart anxiously back and forth between Arthur and Mister Nicholas.
2815,Arthur,"......What are you trying to say, Nicholas?"
2816,Nicholas,"Aside from Prince Arthur, the knight Cain, and the noble from Blanchett, the wizards are a bunch of rogues. We can't say for sure whether they fought the < Great Catastrophe > seriously. Did they truly try to save the world? As Lord Vincent says, it is imperative that we carry out a thorough investigation to assess the cause of this year's disastrous outcome. That is to say: did the threat of the < Great Catastrophe > actually grow stronger, or was it mere negligence on the wizards' part?"
2817,Arthur,"Did you say negligence......? You're overstepping, Nicholas. Do not forget that they lost their very own comrades."
2818,Nicholas,"Well, with all due respect, Prince Arthur. We don't even know how their comrades turned into stone. For all we know, they might have had a falling out amongst themselves and caused an internal conflict."
2819,Arthur,How preposterous...... Why would they be killing each other on the eve of the battle with the < Great Catastrophe >?
2820,Nicholas,"There's no evidence to disprove the possibility. The battle between the < Great Catastrophe > and the Sage's wizards is kept a close secret, after all. Wizards who participated in the previous battle might be lauded as war heroes - but they are also war criminals who brought about immense pain and suffering."
2821,Narrator,"Nicholas' cold voice rings out across the room. What he's saying is that the wizards lost their comrades because they didn't do their jobs. Shylock re-crosses his arms, lifting an eyebrow and murmuring lightly."
2822,Shylock,...... Thank goodness Faust isn't here right now.
2823,Murr,You're right! That guy would've been cursed to death!
2824,Cain,"If Prince Arthur weren't there, I'd have slugged him myself."
2825,Snow,"Oh my. The Eastern wizards, the Western wizards, and the Central wizards are all so scary......"
2826,White,That's right. Us Northern wizards are the only gentle ones around here......
2827,Heathcliff,"Please, I don't quite see how the Northern wizards could be described as gentle. You must be talking about the Southern wizards. See, like Mister Rutile......"
2828,Narrator,"At that moment, the Southern wizard Rutile walks right up to Nicholas."
2829,Rutile,What do you mean by that!?
2830,Heathcliff,............
2831,Shylock,I'm afraid there's no such thing as a gentle wizard.
2832,Murr,"You're right! North, South, East, West, Central - we all love to fight!"
2833,Cain,"I always thought the little brother seemed pretty strong-willed, but I guess that goes for the older one too."
2834,Snow,"Well, he is the son of the great witch Tiretta."
2835,White,Tiretta was a woman with a temper. You really can't fight your bloodline.
2836,Nicholas,You insolent fool. Give me your name.
2837,Rutile,"I am the Southern wizard, Rutile. May I ask - when you speak of these useless wizards, are you referring to the Southern wizards who died in battle, and everyone here who survived?"
2838,Nicholas,"Yes, exactly. They failed to prevent the < Great Catastrophe > from drawing close, causing an unforeseen level of disastrous damage. What else could you call them but useless?"
2839,Rutile,"Then what are you? You, who did not even fight the < Great Catastrophe >? I believe that would make you less than useless, would it not?"
2840,Narrator,"At Rutile's words, Nicholas' imperturbable expression dissolves."
2841,Nicholas,You insolent wizard....... You think you can get away with such arrogance simply because you can use magic? I'll show you!
2842,Arthur,"Stop it, Nicholas! The Southern wizards all died in the last battle. There were people he knew among them! You are the one who made inappropriate remarks on this celebratory occasion. You are the one who ought to apologize!"
2843,Nicholas,"Prince Arthur! Do you mean to side with these wizards over me, when my military family has served the crown for generations?"
2844,Arthur,I am not siding with anyone! I am assessing the situation from an objective standpoint....
2845,Vincent,"Do not blame him, Nicholas. Arthur is still young. Of course he would side with the wizards. He must still hold a grudge towards his own mother, the Queen, for abandoning him."
2846,Arthur,......I bear no resentment towards Mother.
2847,Vincent,"Is that so? Then you truly are a wizard. A normal human would despise his parents if they abandoned him. As a normal human, I simply cannot understand."
2848,Arthur,...... Why do you refuse to listen to anything we have to say!? What is wrong with what I've said? What is wrong with what Rutile said!?
2849,Nicholas,"Please stop acting like you're the victim here: you are the ones who possess such terrifying power. What strikes fear into the people's hearts isn't just the < Great Catastrophe > - it's you wizards, too."
2850,Arthur,"We are all trying to be helpful! That goes for myself, and everyone here in this room......"
2851,Nicholas,"That might be true for you, Prince Arthur, but it does not mean that the other wizards feel the same way. As we can see, neither the legendary wizard Oz nor the Northern wizards have seen fit to gather here with us today."
2852,Arthur,......That's........
2853,Nicholas,"They do not care about the people suffering in this world. That is why they have turned their backs on their roles, and brought about so many casualties. I am certain that the Southern wizard who dared call me useless will likewise run away one day. We need to educate him properly before that happens. Take him away."
2854,Narrator,(Rustle)
2855,Rutile,.......Let go of me......!
2856,Arthur,"Stop it, Nicholas......!"
2857,Mitile,"Nii-sama......! What should we do, Dr. Figaro......."
2858,Figaro,"Oh boy...... Don't kill them, Lennox."
2859,Lennox,I'm not you.
2860,Snow,This won't do! You mustn't lay a finger on the humans!
2861,White,We'll end up fighting the humans before we fight the < Great Catastrophe >!
2862,Narrator,At that moment......
2863,Narrator,(Thunder)
2864,Narrator,A resounding crash of thunder reverberates throughout the room.
2865,Akira,......!
2866,Narrator,"In an instant, the cloudless blue sky is engulfed by dark, rolling clouds. Even though the wind is still, the lights in the room go out, plunging the animated ballroom into a grey, ominous darkness."
2867,Central Country man,Eeek......!
2868,Central Country man,What in the world......!?
2869,Central Country man,It can't be...... Did the < Great Catastrophe > approach again......
2870,Vincent,......Impossible......
2871,Narrator,"The windows rattle violently, and everyone holds their breath at the unsettling atmosphere. A strained silence hangs oppressively in the air, marking the unexpected turn of the night. Suddenly, a man's low voice rings out."
2872,???,<< Arthim >>
2873,Central Country man,............!? What was that.......!?
2874,Central Country man,Was that a magic spell......!?
2875,Snow,......That voice just now......
2876,White,Could it be Mithra......!?
2877,Akira,Mithra......!?
2878,Narrator,"At that name, I recall what the sage's manual says about Mithra. ""Mithra. Maximum warning."" ""Don't be fooled by his looks and his polite speech."" ""He's a beast. He'll kill you."" And then...... Bang! The ground starts to shake."
2879,Akira,............!?
2880,Narrator,(Rumbling)
2881,Akira,............!?
2882,Central Country noblewoman,Eep......!
2883,Rustica,"Oh no. Are you all right, my lady?"
2884,Drummond,"M-Mithra of the North......! He's savage and brutal, and his magical power is second only to Oz's......! C-could he have heard us just now - is he coming for us in a fit of anger?"
2885,Nicholas,Th-that can't be......
2886,Narrator,(Thud)
2887,Vincent,......Secure the castle perimeters!
2888,Central Country nobleman,Eek......! The Northern wizards are going to kill us all......!
2889,Snow,"Shylock, Murr. If Mithra starts a rampage, do you think you could stop him?"
2890,Shylock,Of course not.
2891,Murr,No way.
2892,White,Thank you for your immediate response.
2893,Shylock & Murr,You're welcome.
2894,Cain,Should we get Faust? But I guess he might just side with Mithra....
2895,Figaro,"No, he's actually quite a softie, so I don't think he'll harm any innocent civilians...."
2896,Shino,Sounds like fun. I'll take him on.
2897,Heathcliff,Don't be an idiot! Stand back!
2898,Shino,Did you just call me an idiot?
2899,Heathcliff,....You can only be so bold because you don't actually know Mithra.....
2900,Shino,........
2901,Heathcliff,....What should we do.... Sir Oz is the only one who can defeat him......
2902,Rutile,....Mithra....? Could he be.... Uncle Mithra....?
2903,Arthur,"Uncle, watch out! Behind you!"
2904,Vincent,.............!
2905,Narrator,"At Arthur's voice, everyone turns to look behind Vincent. A giant, glowing door mysteriously materializes into the space where there had only been a wall."
2906,Narrator,(Creak)
2907,Narrator,"The door swings open, pale light spilling from the cracks."
2908,Akira,..............
2909,Arthur,This is.......
2910,Narrator,"Arthur moves to shield Mister Vincent, narrowing his eyes against the bright light emanating from the door. Something blows into the room through the open door. - It's a blizzard."
2911,Akira,............!
2912,Narrator,"When my eyes grow used to the brightness, I see him."
2913,Narrator,"A young man, leaning wordlessly against the door, silvery flakes of fine snow falling onto his shoulders. Exuding an air of striking sensuality, he is too handsome a man to call a beast."
2914,Mithra,"Hello. I'm the Northern wizard, Mithra. Though I suppose I am an uninvited guest. Excuse me."
2915,Narrator,"With an easy languor to his movements, he pushes his tall, slender figure off the doorframe and walks forward. Snow, White, Shylock, and even Figaro look nervous. And then the looks on their faces turn to despair. Because Mithra isn't the only figure to emerge from the door."
2916,Snow,....Owen....
2917,White,So you came too.....
2918,Owen,....... Haha.......
2919,Narrator,"The young man, as lifeless as a corpse, smiles faintly. The moment I set my eyes on him, my skin prickles with goosebumps. The depths of his smiling eyes hold no trace of human emotion. They emit only a cold, terrifying light. But I am familiar with the colors of his eyes."
2920,Owen,How rude. Is nobody going to welcome me? I'm the Northern wizard Owen. Nice to meet you.
2921,Narrator,Owen's footsteps echo quietly as he cuts his way across the room. Everyone stares at their feet in cold despair; nobody wants to make eye contact with him. With the exception of one person.
2922,Cain,Owen....!
2923,Owen,"...Oh my, Sir Knight. It suits you quite well - my eyeball, that is."
2924,Akira,(That's right....) (Owen is the one who stole Cain's eye.....)
2925,Cain,So you're the only person I can see..... This is some cruel irony.
2926,Owen,Fufu... What are you talking about?
2927,Narrator,"Owen smiles sardonically, turning to look back at the door. The person who steps out next is someone I've met before."
2928,Bradley,"Tch.... Northern wizard, Bradley."
2929,Akira,......Bradley......!
2930,Narrator,"It's Bradley, who suddenly disappeared the other night. Someone told me that he was a prisoner."
2931,Bradley,Just when I thought I could finally kick back and get away from it all... I had to get dragged back into this fucking mess.
2932,Narrator,"Bradley brushes the snow off himself and strides forward into the room. At the sight of Bradley's figure, one person stands rooted to the spot in bewilderment."
2933,Nero,............
2934,Bradley,"Hey, Nero. It sure has been a while. Did you have fun going clean and washing your hands of the bandit gang while I was stuck in jail?"
2935,Riquet,.......Bandit gang......?
2936,Nero,......This has nothing to do with you.
2937,Bradley,"Ahaha! That crest! So you were chosen too, Nero!"
2938,Nero,...............
2939,Narrator,"The sudden arrival of the three Northern wizards... Sinks the atmosphere of the magnificent ballroom into terror and despair. A clear demonstration of the overwhelming power they wield. Mithra. Owen. Bradley. If they put their minds to it, they could easily take this castle for themselves. Even Mister Vincent doesn't dare move a muscle. Yet they show no signs of attacking. They simply turn towards the strange door behind them, looking annoyed. As if waiting for someone."
2940,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2941,Narrator,The last person to step out of the door is......
2942,Oz,..........
2943,Akira,....Oz.....
2944,Arthur,......Sir Oz......!
2945,Narrator,"-Oz, holding his mysterious staff in one hand. The strange door waits for Oz to cross its threshold before easing shut with a solemn thud. Then it vanishes, as if a mere illusion, leaving behind only a light dusting of snow. Everyone stares at Oz in sheer disbelief. Oz doesn't say anything."
2946,Akira,(Oz...... Did he.......) (Did he hear us out......?) (That's why he forced the Northern wizards into submission and brought them here......)
2947,Oz,"I'm the Central wizard, Oz. Now all of the Sage's wizards have assembled. Younger brother of the King of Central. If you are still dissatisfied, speak your mind now."
2948,Vincent,.............
2949,Narrator,"Faced with Oz's glare, Mister Vincent looks away, like he's trying to escape."
2950,Vincent,......I extend a sincere welcome.
2951,Narrator,Everyone in the ballroom breathes a sigh of relief at the reply bitterly wrung out of Mister Vincent's throat. Murr smiles and raises his glass.
2952,Murr,"Alright then, let the party go on!"
2953,Narrator,"The cheering continues, and the party vigorously swings back to life."
2954,Narrator,(Footsteps)
2955,Narrator,"Arthur runs up to Oz's side, a smile stretched over his face."
2956,Arthur,Sir Oz! Thank you very much!
2957,Oz,........
2958,Narrator,He looks at Arthur without saying a word and then curtly averts his eyes.
2959,Oz,There is no reason for you to thank me.
2960,Arthur,"...Ah.... Yes, I am aware. But you made everyone so happy."
2961,Oz,........ Sage.
2962,Narrator,"Oz says, looking at me."
2963,Oz,I've fulfilled my duty.
2964,Narrator,"And then, just like that- For the first time, all of the wizards of the magic headquarters have gathered together."
2965,Narrator,"Some tension still lingers in the air, but everyone seems to be enjoying the party. I observe Mithra. His tall, slender figure makes for an attractive sight; his cool gaze would probably cause riots amongst girls."
2966,Akira,"(He has such a polite manner that I can't really see what makes him a ""beast,"" but......)"
2967,Narrator,"Just as the thought enters my mind, Mithra reaches forward with long fingers that look like they belong to an artist, and grabs a piece of meat."
2968,Akira,............!
2969,Mithra,......Chomp.......
2970,Narrator,"And then he bites into it, gnawing and tearing off huge chunks. Mithra chews away without sparing a thought for his handsome face, his fingers and lips sticky with grease."
2971,Akira,"(......He has such a pretty face, but......)"
2972,Snow,"Glad you came, Mithra. I was worried that the gates of hell would burst open."
2973,Mithra,Oz dragged me here by force......
2974,Narrator,"Mithra showcases his lack of manners by licking his fingers and narrowing his eyes in resentment. His behavior is vulgar and wild, but there is a languid attractiveness to him."
2975,Mithra,I really will kill him one day.
2976,White,"Now, now. Thanks to him, you get to eat this delicious food."
2977,Mithra,It's all the same once it ends up in your stomach.
2978,Snow,"Oh, that's right. Let me introduce the sage."
2979,Narrator,I wince when Snow and White direct the conversation to me. Mithra looks over at me nonchalantly.
2980,Akira,"Ah...... I'm the Sage, Akira. Nice to meet you."
2981,Mithra,Yeah. Hello......
2982,Narrator,"Mithra greets me offhandedly, then suddenly brings his face close to mine. He sniffs around the nape of my neck, and steps back like nothing happened."
2983,Mithra,I see.....
2984,Akira,(W-what was that.......!?)
2985,Mithra,"By the way, why was I called here? Are you sure I don't have to defeat anything or kill anyone?"
2986,Snow,You certainly are hot-blooded. The Sage will assign you a role - try asking him.
2987,Akira,Eh!?
2988,Narrator,"I flounder as the topic swings back to me. Mithra sinks his teeth into the meat, tilting his head to one side."
2989,Mithra,What should I do?
2990,Mithra,What should I do?
2991,Akira,"Um... For today, please have an enjoyable night with the other wizards and the people of Central."
2992,Mithra,...... That's it?
2993,Akira,Th...... That's it.
2994,Narrator,"Mithra gazes at me for a moment, then breaks into an amused smile."
2995,Mithra,Ahaha.
2996,Narrator,"He smiles, as carefree as a child. I'm mesmerized by this unexpected expression. Mithra shakes his head cheerfully."
2997,Mithra,"Oh, most certainly. Oz should have just said that from the start."
2998,Akira,Wh...... What did Oz tell you?
2999,Mithra,"He said, ""Obey me."" Naturally, we ended up trying to kill each other. He really infuriates me."
3000,Narrator,"Mithra lifts a hand, still sticky with grease, to sweep his long fringe aside. I reflexively grab a napkin and stuff it into his hand. Mithra blinks at me with a confused look on his face."
3001,Akira,"Um, you'll get grease in your hair if you do that, so I think you should wipe your hands first."
3002,Mithra,What's wrong with that?
3003,Akira,"I... I mean, if you're okay with it..."
3004,Mithra,"Okay... I'll try using it, then."
3005,Narrator,"Mithra wipes his fingers with the napkin, still looking slightly mystified. When I point to his lips, he uses the napkin to wipe his mouth as well. For some reason, the twins look deeply moved."
3006,Snow,I never thought I would witness Mithra wiping his mouth with a napkin....
3007,White,You really do live to see all sorts of wonders....
3008,Narrator,"Mithra looks like he'd be suited for an elegant dinner at a high-class restaurant, yet he's incredibly informal when it comes to a lot of things. As soon as he wipes his hands, he grabs an ornamental apple and bites into it."
3009,Mithra,"Well then, I'll take a walk around. I just have to be nice to the people who speak to me, right?"
3010,Snow,I don't think anyone will try to speak to you... You should try speaking to them instead.
3011,Mithra,Okay...... What should I say?
3012,White,"You could say, ""Hello""?"
3013,Snow,"Or something like, ""It's lovely weather""?"
3014,Narrator,Mithra laughs wryly with a shake of his shoulders.
3015,Mithra,I understand. Humans certainly take it into their minds to do foolish things.
3016,Snow,Don't kill them.
3017,White,You must not kill them.
3018,Mithra,"Well, I'll try my best."
3019,Narrator,"Mithra strolls off, and the twins watch his back before turning to me."
3020,Snow,"We're a little worried, so we'll go follow him."
3021,White,"Sage, take your time and enjoy yourself too."
3022,Akira,"Yes, I understand."
3023,Narrator,"I nod, seeing them off. I feel a brief sense of relief; I was terrified of Mithra, but I managed to speak to him normally. At this rate, maybe I can have a conversation with Owen, too. With that thought in mind, I look around the room. My eyes land on Owen immediately. -He, too, is looking right at me. With a smile on his face."
3024,Narrator,"The next moment, I find myself on the balcony."
3025,Akira,Huh......!?
3026,Owen,Hey.
3027,Akira,Owen...... We were inside just a moment ago.....
3028,Owen,I called you here.
3029,Akira,You did....?
3030,Owen,"I have no friends, so I wanted you to speak to me. Sir Sage."
3031,Narrator,"I gaze at Owen incredulously, because I've heard so many scary rumours about him. Owen smiles sadly."
3032,Owen,That look on your face... It's fine. I'm used to it. Was I a bother? I'll send you back inside.
3033,Akira,Ah... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.....
3034,Narrator,I'm taken aback by how lonely Owen looks. But now that I think about it - all my knowledge of him comes from rumors. I don't know the real Owen.
3035,Akira,"Let's talk, Owen. I wanted to speak with you too."
3036,Owen,Talk about what?
3037,Akira,"Um.... I'd love to know what kind of person you are, Owen. We will probably be seeing a lot of each other from here on out, so I want to get along...."
3038,Owen,Ahaha.....
3039,Narrator,Owen smiles faintly. The setting sun burns behind him. Beautifully ominous purple clouds drift across the sky.
3040,Owen,I want to talk about myself too. But I don't know much about myself.
3041,Akira,Huh....?
3042,Owen,"But I do know about you - you, the Sage who is all alone."
3043,Narrator,"His eyes - the same color as Cain's - glint with amusement. And as I stare into those eyes, I'm overcome by a sudden surge of loneliness."
3044,Owen,Want me to tell you?
3045,Akira,About what....?
3046,Owen,"About yourself. What people think of you. What will make people laugh at you. What will make people loathe you. What will make people praise you. Did the parade make you feel good? Did the party make you happy? Those are mere tricks made to fool children. The wizards and the people you met in this world - they don't actually care about you at all. If you act like a sage, they're willing to speak to you, but the moment you forget your duty, they will shower you with criticism. Because nobody has business with you unless you're the Sage - and you must feel the same way too."
3047,Akira,...What are you saying...?
3048,Owen,"When you think about yourself, don't you get extremely.... Anxious? Don't you feel so lonely?"
3049,Akira,.......
3050,Narrator,"I take a step back, suddenly terrified. Owen steps closer, still smiling."
3051,Owen,Why are you running away? I'm talking about you. Do you hate yourself so much that you want to run away? Is your true self someone you'd rather avert your eyes from?
3052,Narrator,"The glow of the red and purple sunset blurs in the light. Owen laughs, narrowing his eyes of different colors. As I stagger, he offers me a hand."
3053,Owen,"Hey.... Let's talk about you. Come on, don't run away. Pity me; don't abandon me. Please guide me, Sir Sage."
3054,Oz,-Owen.
3055,Owen,..........
3056,Narrator,That's when I realize that Oz has appeared on the balcony with us. Owen purses his lips as if he's lost interest.
3057,Owen,What is it? Can't you see we're busy talking?
3058,Oz,Stay away from the Sage.
3059,Oz,Stay away from the Sage.
3060,Owen,Oh? But you were the one who brought me here?
3061,Narrator,"Oz replies, unmoved by Owen's sneering."
3062,Oz,I did.
3063,Owen,......Hmph.
3064,Narrator,"Owen glares sulkily at Oz. And then he slides away from me. As his form begins to vanish like smoke, he flashes a wicked smile at Oz."
3065,Owen,"No use pretending you're a good boy, Oz. I know who you really are - you're the king of demons, scarier than the < Great Catastrophe > itself."
3066,Oz,"Do you want me to kill you again, Owen?"
3067,Owen,Fufu...... Ahaha......
3068,Narrator,"Owen disappears, leaving behind only his laughter."
3069,Akira,....Ah....
3070,Oz,Do not worry. He's probably somewhere near.
3071,Narrator,I let out a sigh of relief. I was afraid I'd chased him off after Oz went through the trouble of bringing him here. The evening breeze sends lavender clouds drifting across the sky.
3072,Akira,"......What did you mean when you said, ""want me to kill you again""......?"
3073,Oz,"Owen has hidden his soul. That is why, no matter how many times he dies, he will always come back to life. What did you talk about with Owen?"
3074,Akira,......Nothing much......
3075,Oz,Do not listen to Owen's words. They will eat away at your soul.
3076,Akira,............
3077,Oz,Did he curse you?
3078,Akira,No...... He simply asked me about myself.
3079,Oz,That is the curse. To speak of yourself to someone you have not opened your heart to - anyone would find that a painful burden to bear.
3080,Narrator,"I feel a sense of relief at Oz's words. Because when I was talking to Owen, some part of me couldn't resist the uncertainty, hopelessness, and guilt."
3081,Oz,......
3082,Narrator,"Oz looks at me intently, like he has something to say. After a while, he turns his gaze towards the twilight sky."
3083,Oz,What is your name?
3084,Akira,Ah...... My name is Akira.
3085,Oz,Akira.
3086,Narrator,Oz says my name carefully.
3087,Oz,"Do not forget your name. The greater your duty, the more easily you come to forget your name. The king, the doctor, the knight, the mother, the child. The Sage. The Northern wizards. Crushed by the weight of the titles forced upon them, they cease to be beings with names, and lose their true selves. I, too, have already forgotten the previous sage's name...."
3088,Akira,Oz......
3089,Oz,"But you still have your own name. Do not forget it, and do not let anyone else forget it."
3090,Narrator,"I feel the weight carried in those words. I nod solemnly, and ask Oz."
3091,Akira,"......Are you also thinking about Arthur, who is a wizard, and the Prince of Central?"
3092,Oz,............
3093,Narrator,"Oz looks stunned. He seems terribly irritated, but he also looks slightly embarrassed."
3094,Oz,.....What are you talking about?
3095,Akira,"You were the one who raised Arthur, right?"
3096,Oz,Don't be foolish.
3097,Narrator,Oz abruptly turns his face to the side.
3098,Oz,That child possessed powerful magic. I simply picked him up to gather his stone.
3099,Akira,Really....?
3100,Oz,That's right. And now he has returned to his parents. ......That is all there is to it.
3101,Akira,But.....
3102,Oz,"Do not concern yourself with others. Take care that you do not forget my warning. If you get tired of being the Sage, you may cast aside your role. Even if you do, you will still be yourself. Do not blindly follow your role. For even if you try to abandon it, it will still follow you. Do not let trivial curses sway your heart."
3103,Narrator,"Though Oz speaks with a strict tone, I can tell it's his way of encouraging and comforting me. I laugh and nod."
3104,Akira,"I understand, Oz. Thank you."
3105,Narrator,"Oz furrows his brows, turning his face away; he says the same thing he said to Arthur earlier."
3106,Oz,There is no reason for you to thank me.
3107,Narrator,"He looks scary, but I think Oz must be a kind person. He reminds me of the boss of the neighborhood cats, who was proud and splendid, with chubby legs. He never got attached to humans, but he was always kind to the mother cats and their kittens. I suppress my laughter at the image, and Oz looks at me with a puzzled face."
3108,Oz,What is it......?
3109,Narrator,(Door opens)
3110,Vincent,"Sir Sage, Oz. So this is where you were."
3111,Akira,You're Arthur's uncle......
3112,Oz,.............
3113,Vincent,I apologize for Nicholas' behavior earlier. I have a favor I'd like to ask of you two.
3114,Akira,A favor......?
3115,Vincent,Look to the north. There's a collapsed tower.
3116,Akira,Ah....... That's the huge tower I saw when I arrived in this world......
3117,Vincent,"The tower is a symbol of Central Country, but it collapsed in an earthquake this morning."
3118,Akira,There was an earthquake?
3119,Vincent,"It seems to have been a highly localized earthquake. There were no other damages, except for the tower and the gate nearby, which has been all but destroyed. Under normal circumstances, we would repair it ourselves. But the people fear that it is a harbinger of further misfortune to come. Could you repair it with magic? I'm sure it would go a long way towards reassuring the people if they could witness such an incredible feat with their own eyes. I've tried asking Arthur, but it proved to be beyond him. But I'm sure it's perfectly possible for one such as the legendary wizard Oz."
3120,Oz,.............
3121,Narrator,"Oz doesn't say anything. Perhaps he's displeased by Vincent's high-handed way of speaking. But if he can restore such an important symbol, surely it would improve the reputation of wizards in the people's eyes. I tentatively observe Oz's expression."
3122,Akira,Oz...... I'm asking this of you as well. Could you please repair the tower?
3123,Oz,".......If that is your wish, Sage."
3124,Vincent,"You have my thanks. Well then, I'll show you to the tower tomorrow......"
3125,Oz,I can do it from here.
3126,Narrator,"Oz murmurs with exasperation, his staff already in hand."
3127,Vincent,Right here...? You mean you're going to repair it right now...?
3128,Oz,Do you have any objections?
3129,Vincent,......No......
3130,Narrator,"Without my realizing, the sky has turned a deep shade of cerulean blue. The outline of the < Great Catastrophe > is faintly visible in the sky. I suddenly recall the bizarre injuries that the < Great Catastrophe > inflicted on the wizards. Snow and White turn into a portrait at nightfall, and Cain cannot see anyone until he touches them. Shylock's heart will suddenly burst into flames. Have Oz and the Northern wizards also been inflicted with injuries from the < Great Catastrophe >?"
3131,Narrator,(Footsteps)
3132,Mithra,What are you doing?
3133,Akira,Mithra....
3134,Arthur,"Sir Oz... Sir Oz, are you going to repair the Central tower for us?"
3135,Akira,"And Arthur...... Yes, that's right."
3136,Mithra,Interesting. Let me watch.
3137,Oz,Do not speak with food in your mouth.
3138,Mithra,"This thing is really hard, you know?"
3139,Arthur,Mithra. You don't have to eat the shells. Please spit them out.
3140,Mithra,"Why? Do you want them? If you do, then it makes me want to eat them all the more."
3141,Arthur,Is that so......? I hope scallop shells aren't bad for your teeth......
3142,Mithra,They're tasting more and more like biscuits.
3143,Oz,"Silence, both of you."
3144,Arthur,S-sorry!
3145,Mithra,"Wahhh, wahhhhh, waaaaaaaaah."
3146,Narrator,"Arthur shrinks back at Oz's reproach, while Mithra lets loose a stream of taunting jeers. Taking a deep breath, Oz raises his staff towards the sky. And solemnly recites his spell."
3147,Oz,<< Vox...... >>
3148,Narrator,"But before he can get to the end of his spell, Oz's eyelids slowly close, and...... His entire body leans over onto me. The next moment, Oz has fallen asleep."
3149,Oz,Zz......
3150,Akira,O-Oz!?
3151,Arthur,Sir Oz!?
3152,Oz,Zz......
3153,Akira,P-please don't fall asleep! Plea...... He's really heavy!
3154,Mithra,What is he doing?
3155,Arthur,"Sir Oz, Sir Oz! Please pull yourself together!"
3156,Oz,........
3157,Narrator,"Arthur shakes Oz's body, and Oz opens his eyes. He gazes at Arthur before surveying the area around him."
3158,Oz,"Where am I...... Right, the Central castle. I was asked to repair the Central tower. By that youth who was all bark and didn't wish to lift a finger himself."
3159,Vincent,.......Are you talking about me?
3160,Oz,I didn't realize you were here. No matter. << Vox...... >> Zz.......
3161,Arthur,Sir Oz....!
3162,Akira,Oz......! Don't fall asleep......!
3163,Mithra,Ahahaha! I'll push him off the balcony while I can!
3164,Arthur,"Don't be so rude! Sir Oz, Sir Oz! Are you all right?"
3165,Oz,"...... Where am I..... Right, the Central castle. I was asked to repair the Central tower."
3166,Arthur,"Sir Oz, you said that just......"
3167,Oz,"Well, no matter. I'll get this done in a second. << Vox...... >> Zz......."
3168,Arthur,Sir Oz......!!
3169,Mithra,Ahahaha! This is the third time!
3170,Arthur,......Don't laugh at Sir Oz! There must be a reason for this!
3171,Akira,"It might be his injury from the < Great Catastrophe >! Everyone who fought the < Great Catastrophe > is suffering from a bizarre injury. Mithra, are you all right?"
3172,Mithra,......Because of the < Great Catastrophe >......?
3173,Oz,...... Where am I.....
3174,Arthur,"Sir Oz...... This is the Central castle. You were asked to repair the Central tower with magic, but...... Because of the < Great Catastrophe >, it looks like you fall asleep every time you try to use magic."
3175,Oz,......... .......Don't be ridiculous...... That cannot be. I was able to use magic against Mithra and Owen.
3176,Mithra,That's right. You nearly killed me.
3177,Arthur,"Then, why......"
3178,Owen,Maybe he can't use it at night?
3179,Akira,Owen......
3180,Oz,"Owen, what is that portrait you're carrying? ...... Is that Snow and White......?"
3181,Owen,These two got trapped inside a frame the moment the sun went down.
3182,Snow in the portrait,"Owen, be a good boy."
3183,White in the portrait,You must treat us with care.
3184,Owen,Can I throw you off the balcony to see if you can fly while you're stuck in the frame?
3185,Snow & White in the portrait,No no no no no no no!
3186,Owen,There we go~.
3187,Narrator,(Whistling sound through the air)
3188,Snow & White in the portrait,Eeeeeeeeek~!
3189,Arthur,Sir Snow! Sir White!
3190,Narrator,Owen tosses the portrait of Snow and White from the balcony.
3191,Akira,W-will they be all right!?
3192,Oz,I can sense their magic. They should be fine.
3193,Owen,Mithra.
3194,Mithra,What is it?
3195,Owen,You should cast away Oz just like that.
3196,Mithra,........
3197,Narrator,"Mithra blinks repeatedly, looking at Oz's bitter expression."
3198,Owen,"You can beat Oz for sure right now. If you kill him, you won't have to obey him anymore."
3199,Mithra,That's true.
3200,Oz,Mithra......
3201,Mithra,There's no way I could lose to you if you can't use magic. I never thought the < Great Catastrophe > would leave me such a blessing......
3202,Oz,......
3203,Mithra,Oz. I'm going to pay you back for all these years.
3204,Akira,Mithra! Wait......
3205,Arthur,Wait!
3206,Narrator,"In a moment, Arthur steps out in front of Oz, both arms spread wide as if he's protecting him. Oz's eyes widen."
3207,Arthur,"I won't let you lay a finger on Sir Oz. If you intend to fight, I will be your opponent."
3208,Mithra,Huh.....
3209,Oz,"Move, Arthur!"
3210,Arthur,I refuse!
3211,Oz,You do not stand a chance against him!
3212,Arthur,Even so!
3213,Oz,.......
3214,Arthur,"I...... I will protect you, Sir Oz. Just as you protected me from avalanches and wolves when I was little! I will definitely protect you!"
3215,Mithra,Interesting. I'll be your opponent.
3216,Oz,"Stop, Mithra!"
3217,Akira,"Arthur, Mithra....!"
3218,Narrator,"Mithra prowls closer towards Arthur, who is still protecting Oz behind his back. A red-and-black light dances in the palm of Mithra's right hand, and panic flashes across Oz's face. I reach out to grab Mithra's hand."
3219,Mithra,"Hey, that's dangerous."
3220,Akira,"Mithra, please wait! If we lose any of the chosen wizards, we might not be able to defeat the < Great Catastrophe >! Then the world might really come to an end!"
3221,Mithra,......You have a point.
3222,Narrator,Owen purses his lips in discontent.
3223,Owen,You're so easy.
3224,Mithra,"But wouldn't it be a problem for you too, Owen? If the world ends, then we die too."
3225,Owen,"Well, true..... Okay, but it's still a good opportunity, so why don't you take an arm or a leg?"
3226,Mithra,I don't make a hobby of collecting body parts like you do.
3227,Owen,I don't either. I just happened to like this eye. But I'd want Oz's arm.
3228,Arthur,What are you going to do with Sir Oz's arm!?
3229,Owen,I'll use it to scratch my back.
3230,Mithra,That sounds convenient.
3231,Owen,And I'll make it pet my head.
3232,Arthur,You should just ask him right now! Sir Oz will pat your head. He did many times when I was little......
3233,Oz,Arthur...... Arthur. That's enough. Keep quiet.
3234,Arthur,But Sir Oz......
3235,Oz,........... << Vox Nox >>
3236,Narrator,"Oz mutters his spell in a low voice. When he does, a new figure appears on the scene. It's Figaro, a Southern wizard."
3237,Figaro,"Huh? Oz, did you call me?"
3238,Oz,......Yaaawn...... It looks like I can manage simple magic.... But I am...... sleepy.....
3239,Figaro,"Hey now, don't call someone over just to yawn in their face."
3240,Narrator,"Everyone is terrified of Oz, but Figaro lectures him so frankly. He also shows no sign of surprise at being summoned out of nowhere. Oz continues."
3241,Oz,"I've temporarily lost my magic. Protect Arthur from Mithra and Owen. You can handle them, right, Figaro?"
3242,Figaro,.............
3243,Akira,"....""You can handle them, right, Figaro""....? Weren't the Southern wizards supposed to be weak....?"
3244,Oz,Figaro is a Northern wizard. He's lived longer than me.
3245,Akira,Huh....!?
3246,Narrator,"I stare at Figaro in amazement. But I am the only one here who is surprised. It seems like Arthur, Mithra, and Owen already know of this."
3247,Figaro,"Hey, can you....."
3248,Narrator,Figaro grumbles at Oz.
3249,Figaro,Can you stop getting in the way of my laid-back lifestyle all the time?
3250,Oz,Laid-back lifestyle?
3251,Figaro,"I'm talking about my peaceful, quiet life. That's how the previous sage described it. Listen, Oz. I want to be a good, average citizen. In Southern Country, I'm just a simple old guy with a naughty streak."
3252,Oz,An old guy with a naughty streak?
3253,Figaro,"Rutile and Mitile don't know of my past. They tell me, ""Dr. Figaro, you're no good at anything."" Isn't that lovely?"
3254,Arthur,"But Sir Figaro, you're good at everything!"
3255,Figaro,"Thanks, Arthur. You're as cute as always. Even though you were raised by such an obstinate guy."
3256,Narrator,"Figaro pats Arthur on the head, and then turns around to look at me ruefully."
3257,Figaro,"Man, Sir Sage found out too. I tried to come onto him like a simple, helpless young man...."
3258,Oz,You came onto the Sage.....
3259,Arthur,You came onto Sir Sage?
3260,Akira,"Um, you didn't seem simple or helpless at all..... You were pretty overwhelming, and I was honestly scared....."
3261,Figaro,No way? Looks like I need to study harder. I wasn't trying to scare you - sorry.
3262,Narrator,Figaro apologizes without a trace of remorse and faces Mithra and Owen. He rolls up his sleeves like a doctor about to inspect his patients.
3263,Figaro,"Anyway, this had better be the last time you ask me to do this sort of thing. ...You want me to handle Mithra and Owen, right?"
3264,Mithra,"Oh, I don't like this man at all."
3265,Figaro,"And I don't want to do this either. You and Owen are both so strong, and I'm getting pretty old....."
3266,Arthur,"But Sir Figaro, you're always so youthful!"
3267,Figaro,"Thank you, Arthur. I guess Sir Figaro will do his best for you, then."
3268,Narrator,"The corners of Figaro's mouth lift into a bold smirk. Mithra, too, is charged with murderous intent. And then....."
3269,Narrator,(Door opens) (Footsteps)
3270,Mitile,Dr. Figaro~.
3271,Rutile,"Dr. Figaro~, are you around?"
3272,Narrator,"Figaro's movements pause at the appearance of the Southern brothers. Abruptly, he turns around cheerfully, all the tension gone from his voice."
3273,Figaro,"Ye~s, what is it~?"
3274,Mitile,The cake is here!
3275,Rutile,It's full of chestnuts - your favorite! Let's eat together.
3276,Figaro,Oh yay~! I'll totally have some!
3277,Oz,......Do you ever question your way of life?
3278,Figaro,"Shut up. ....Anyway, looks like I can't help you. Sorry."
3279,Oz,....You're going to leave me for chestnuts?
3280,Figaro,"I can steal chestnuts from a merchant at any time. I'm leaving for them, because I want to reciprocate their sincerity with equal goodness. I'm a kind man, after all. And you should try to get along with Mithra too. Share a cake or two. Love and friendship are wonderful things, you know."
3281,Rutile,"Dr. Figaro, were you still speaking to Sir Sage and the others?"
3282,Figaro,"Oh, no worries. We're all done-."
3283,Rutile,Would everyone else like some cake too? I'll bring you slices if you'd like.
3284,Akira,"Ah, no, we....."
3285,Owen,There's cake?
3286,Akira,"Woah....! You surprised me, suddenly appearing behind my back......"
3287,Owen,Maybe I'll have some.
3288,Rutile,"Then I'll bring you some. How about you, Sir Oz, Prince Arthur, and Mister Mithra?"
3289,Oz,I'm fine.
3290,Arthur,"No, thank you."
3291,Mithra,I'll eat anything but scallop shells.
3292,Arthur,See? They weren't good after all.
3293,Mithra,But I ate something with a similar shape once - it was soft and sweet and delicious. Perhaps the flavor changes with the harvesting season.
3294,Arthur,"Ah, that must've been a madeline. I'll ask the maids to bring you some."
3295,Owen,I'll eat lots of cakes. Can you pile them up onto a big plate?
3296,Rutile,Got it. I see you really like sweets.
3297,Owen,Yup.
3298,Mitile,What's your favorite kind of cake? I'll bring it to you if they have it.
3299,Owen,"It's made of utterly crushed up red fruits, loaded with piles of sugar, and simmered down until it's like an open wound that's just recovering."
3300,Mitile,..... Huh....?
3301,Rutile,Maybe he's talking about jam?
3302,Mitile,"Huh. Oh, I see it now. I'll bring you some."
3303,Owen,"I like cream too. The slimy, fluffy stuff that sticks all over your hands. I'd compare it to...."
3304,Mitile,Y-you don't have to compare it to anything. I'm good.
3305,Owen,I want to stuff my mouth completely full with it. So it'll spill out of the corners of my lips when I close them.
3306,Mitile,"I see..... ...Yeah, the Northern wizards are kind of scary..... I don't think we'll get along....."
3307,Rutile,Don't say that. Plus.....
3308,Mitile,Plus what....? What are you looking at - Mister Mithra?
3309,Rutile,"....He might be Mother's friend.... I'll ask him later. Well then, see you in a bit, everyone."
3310,Figaro,"Thanks, Rutile, Mitile."
3311,Owen,There's going to be cake.
3312,Narrator,"Owen looks highly pleased, and even Mithra seems to have lost his will to fight."
3313,Mithra,"It's warm here, even at night. Good thing I didn't bring a jacket."
3314,Owen,"I like the stuff that's drenched in sweet rum, too. Wonder what that's called."
3315,Narrator,I look at the two of them contemplatively.
3316,Akira,"(These two....... They're scary, but they can also be really easygoing......) (Huh......?) (Is that Nero under the balcony? Is he with someone.....?) (Or am I just imagining things......?)"
3317,Bradley,"Tch... I finally got my hands on some good food. Don't get in my way like that. Why'd you drag me out here, Nero?"
3318,Nero,"Don't give me that shit. I heard rumors about you becoming a Sage's wizard, but when did they let you out? I thought you were supposed to be locked up unless you were fighting the < Great Catastrophe >?"
3319,Bradley,"Well, I am. Even when they let me out of prison, Snow and White wouldn't take their eyes off me in the magical headquarters; I never got a chance to escape. But I managed to break free the other day by chance."
3320,Nero,How.
3321,Bradley,I sneezed and got blasted far away.
3322,Nero,......You sneezed?
3323,Bradley,Yeah.
3324,Nero,"Like, ah-choo?"
3325,Bradley,Yeah.
3326,Nero,"............. Hey, stop fucking around."
3327,Bradley,"Listen, it sounds stupid as hell, but it's true! Every time I sneeze, I get blasted away."
3328,Nero,Seriously? What are you gonna do when you catch a cold?
3329,Bradley,"Well, I guess I'd be stuck taking a tour around the world. Tch.... What the hell's going on.....? And I ended up getting dragged back by Oz anyway."
3330,Nero,"A sneeze, huh...."
3331,Bradley,"How about you, Nero? Our gang fell apart before I knew it. I thought you'd keep the guys together."
3332,Nero,I went clean. I won't tag along with your bullshit jobs.
3333,Bradley,"Hey, don't be like that. Let's work together again. We'll get outta here and stir up a real storm."
3334,Nero,I'm making an honest living now. Don't drag me into this.
3335,Bradley,An honest living? What are you doing?
3336,Nero,......I run a restaurant in the East.
3337,Bradley,You're running a restaurant? Ahahaha!
3338,Nero,.........
3339,Bradley,".......Well, I guess that's not a bad idea... Your food was real good, after all. I see.... That's disappointing, but I guess that's how it is. Cook meals, watch horses, do whatever you want."
3340,Nero,........ That's it.....?
3341,Bradley,What do you mean?
3342,Nero,You said you'd kill me if I left the gang.
3343,Bradley,"What's the point in killing a restaurant owner? Plus, I got caught, and now they've even got me working as a Sage's wizard."
3344,Nero,..........
3345,Bradley,But there is one thing I want to ask you.
3346,Nero,.....What?
3347,Bradley,"Where were you on the night I was captured? If you had been there, I never would've been caught."
3348,Nero,...........
3349,Bradley,"I'm not here to blame you or anything. But I always wanted to know what happened to you. Spit it out, Nero."
3350,Nero,......I......
3351,Bradley,"Ahaha! Hey, what's wrong? Don't look so serious! It's not like I got caught because of you. I just wanna hear the truth."
3352,Nero,...........
3353,Bradley,Nero.......?
3354,Snow & White in the portrait,Eeeeeeeeee!
3355,Narrator,(Thump)
3356,Bradley,......!? Ow......!? This thing came crashing down on my head!
3357,Nero,"Snow, White......?"
3358,White in the portrait,We didn't want to come crashing down on your head either!
3359,Snow in the portrait,Owen threw us off the balcony! Go complain to Owen instead!
3360,Bradley,Tch...... That guy's creepy as hell. I'm gonna kill him one day.....
3361,Nero,"Right, you guys get stuck in this frame because of your bizarre injury...."
3362,Snow in the portrait,It's so inconvenient...... Hm......!?
3363,White in the portrait,"Look at the sky, Nero, Bradley!"
3364,Nero,.....? What are those things....? ......Wizards with wings....?
3365,Bradley,......No...... Those guys aren't wizards.
3366,Snow in the portrait,They're the Magical Technology Corps of Central Country.
3367,Bradley,Magical Technology Corps.......?
3368,White in the portrait,Those who use machines fueled by mana stones to generate magic.
3369,Snow in the portrait,Now let's see what they plan to do with the collapsed Central tower....
3370,Rutile,"Sir Sage, Sir Oz, look.....!"
3371,Arthur,That's our country's Magical Technology Corps....
3372,Vincent,"I wanted the Sage's wizards to perform the deed for us, but instead of a miracle, you staged us a comedy."
3373,Oz,............
3374,Vincent,Let me show you the power of our Magical Technology Corps.
3375,Central Country man,"Ah..... Look, wizards.....!"
3376,Central Country man,No...... Isn't that the Magical Technology Corps? I hear they obtained the technology from Western Country.
3377,Central Country man,What are they doing...? Maybe they're going to fix the Central tower for us?
3378,Central Country man,That would be great...... It feels awful seeing the tower collapsed like that.
3379,Nicholas,"The scene is even more disastrous than I expected...... I have to...... No, I will definitely fix this."
3380,Central Country woman,Lord Nicholas!
3381,Central Country man,"It's the head of the Magical Technology Corps, Lord Nicholas!"
3382,Nicholas,"We cannot repair the Central tower itself, but the power of the Magical Technology Corps is more than enough to repair the gates surrounding the tower. Witness the power of magical technology!"
3383,Central Country woman,......Woah......!
3384,Central Country man,Incredible! It's just like magic......!
3385,Central Country man,I'm amazed - is this really just technology? We have no need for wizards anymore!
3386,Central Country woman,"Ahaha, don't say that! The wizards just went through all that trouble to hold a fancy parade and all, too!"
3387,Central Country man,Hahahahahaha!
3388,Mitile,"So that's...... The power of the Magical Technology Corps...... ......Um, what's this technology they speak of......?"
3389,Rutile,Who knows...... I have no idea......
3390,Shylock,....... How eerie......
3391,Narrator,"At Shylock's low murmur, I turn to look at him. He gazes coldly across the expanse beneath the distant skies."
3392,Akira,Eerie.....?
3393,Shylock,"It is absolutely chilling. There is no way to resist pleasure that comes without pain. They do not use their hearts, as wizards do; nor do they use their bodies, as humans do. If humans can simply achieve their wishes through the mere powers of stones.... They will recreate the world like children playing in a sandbox."
3394,Murr,What are you looking at? Something fun? Something amazing?
3395,Shylock,"It may be fun and amazing to you. Take a look, Murr, genius of the ages. The magical technology you invented is creating a twisted miracle."
3396,Akira,....Murr invented....?
3397,Shylock,"Indeed. The previous Murr was the one who invented the magical science technique fueled by mana stones. Murr was a philosopher, an inventor, an astronomer, a mineralogist, and a monster of intellectual curiosity. But he never once spared a thought for the consequences of exposing the secrets of this world - of how it would reshape this world. Even though I tried to stop him time and again."
3398,Murr,I don't get what you're talking about!
3399,Narrator,Shylock glances at Murr and smiles cynically.
3400,Shylock,Of course you wouldn't. That's why I hated you.
3401,Narrator,Murr looks like he's about to say something. But his reply is interrupted by Vincent's voice resounding across the balcony.
3402,Vincent,Everything is proceeding as planned. It looks like there's nothing for the wizards to do here.
3403,Arthur,"......Uncle, surely you didn't have to phrase it that way......."
3404,Akira,......
3405,Narrator,"Before I realize it, Shylock and Murr have disappeared. Instead, Figaro stands close to me, an unusually somber expression on his face."
3406,Figaro,".....The Magical Technology Corps, huh. If that stuff spreads, we're going to be in trouble."
3407,Akira,Figaro....
3408,Figaro,"At this rate, they'll start hunting wizards."
3409,Akira,....Hunting wizards...?
3410,Figaro,Yes.
3411,Akira,What does that mean?
3412,Figaro,I'll give you the details later. I can't explain anything here.
3413,Vincent,Did you say something?
3414,Figaro,"Nothing at all, your Highness."
3415,Shino,......Something's going on outside.
3416,Heathcliff,I wonder what they're doing... I'll go check.
3417,Shino,Yeah.
3418,Young Maid,....It's pointless. It's going to collapse again anyway.....
3419,Shino,......
3420,Young Maid,The tower wasn't destroyed by an earthquake.....
3421,Shino,What do you mean?
3422,Young Maid,....It's nothing. Excuse me....
3423,Shino,Wait.
3424,Young Maid,........
3425,Shino,Don't worry. I won't eat you or anything - I'm already full from that delicious pie.
3426,Young Maid,Was the pie good.....?
3427,Shino,Yeah.
3428,Young Maid,"My mother baked it..... She works in the kitchen, you see."
3429,Shino,Your mom is a genius. Please tell her that.
3430,Young Maid,"Yes... Fufu, she'll be glad to hear that."
3431,Shino,So what was that about the tower?
3432,Young Maid,"The tower wasn't destroyed by an earthquake. There was no earthquake. I saw.... I saw a giant shadow emerge out of the cemetery, crawl up the hill, and latch itself onto the tower."
3433,Shino,A shadow?
3434,Young Maid,Yes.... It was the shadow of... A giant bird.
3435,Heathcliff,The shadow of a bird? Are you sure she didn't mistake it for the shadow of a cloud?
3436,Shino,"I asked a bunch of people, but they all said they didn't sense an earthquake. Something else must've caused the tower to collapse."
3437,Heathcliff,"Where are you going, Shino?"
3438,Shino,I'm going to check out the cemetery.
3439,Heathcliff,Right now!?
3440,Shino,"Yeah. You're all staying the night here, right? I'll be back by morning."
3441,Heathcliff,It's dangerous to go alone.
3442,Akira,"It looks like everyone's rooms are ready. Oh, Heath, Shino, is something the matter?"
3443,Shino,I'm going to find out what monster brought that tower down.
3444,Akira,A monster...? So it really wasn't an earthquake.....
3445,Heathcliff,"You thought it was weird too, Sir Sage?"
3446,Akira,"There were lots of earthquakes back in my world, so.... Normally, when there's a tremor strong enough to bring a tower down, the surrounding regions also shake quite a bit. But I didn't feel anything. Even if it happened while we were flying, we should've been able to tell by observing the people and animals on the ground."
3447,Shino,The maid told me that the shadow of a bird crawled out of the cemetery and latched itself onto the tower.
3448,Akira,"If it's an ancient creature, maybe Snow and White would know something about it...."
3449,Shino,Please ask them about it. I'm headed off.
3450,Heathcliff,"Hey, wait!"
3451,Shino,What?
3452,Heathcliff,....... It's dangerous. I'll go with you.
3453,Shino,Heath? Headed to a cemetery? In the middle of the night? Did you forget that you're afraid of ghosts despite being a wizard?
3454,Heathcliff,Shut up.
3455,Akira,I'm worried about just the two of you going alone. I'll come along too.
3456,Heathcliff,"But Sir Sage, it's even more dangerous for you."
3457,Shino,You're not going to be of any help.
3458,Heathcliff,Shino.
3459,Shino,"It's dangerous, Sir Sage. Please get a good night's rest in bed."
3460,Akira,Then you should at least take someone else with you.....
3461,Narrator,(Footsteps)
3462,Faust,Why haven't you headed to your rooms? The party should already be over.
3463,Nero,"Yeah, it ended while you were napping."
3464,Heathcliff,"Mr. Faust, Nero."
3465,Shino,Where were you guys?
3466,Nero,The pantry.
3467,Faust,"I missed my meal, you see. I'm about to have a late evening drink with the wine that Nero snagged."
3468,Heathcliff,You're drinking together?
3469,Faust & Nero,No way.
3470,Faust,Alone.
3471,Nero,You're supposed to enjoy a late night drink all alone.
3472,Akira,"I see the Eastern wizards really love being alone...... Faust, Nero. I apologize, because I know it's quite late, but may I ask you two a favor?"
3473,Nero,Uh......
3474,Faust,No.
3475,Akira,............
3476,Shino,It's fine. Heath and I will just go together.
3477,Heathcliff,"Shino, wait up! .....Ah, Sir Sage, Mr. Faust, Nero. Good night."
3478,Faust,Where are you going?
3479,Nero,"Central Country might be a pretty safe place, but you two are still a bit too young for adventures after dark."
3480,Heathcliff,"Well, you see...."
3481,Faust,"Oh, please.... How did I get dragged into this mess......"
3482,Heathcliff,"I'm sorry, Mr. Faust."
3483,Nero,"You're the one who said, ""It's dangerous for two children to be headed out alone,"" even before Mister Sage could say it. For someone who complains about everything, you're a pretty earnest guy."
3484,Faust,"And you're tagging along with us, so that goes for you too."
3485,Akira,You're both very kind.
3486,Nero,"You didn't have to come along, you know. If something happens to you, the higher-ups are going to yell at us."
3487,Akira,Who are the higher-ups?
3488,Nero,"Like Oz, or Snow and White?"
3489,Akira,I'm sorry... I wanted to take a look at the world outside of the castle.
3490,Faust,There's little to see here; isn't it a boring sight? Hardly anyone walks through the streets at night.
3491,Akira,"It's quite dark, after all...."
3492,Faust,"That's right. We fear the < Great Catastrophe >; yet we must rely on its light. We're such inconsistent, selfish beings."
3493,Shino,I can see the cemetery.
3494,Heathcliff,"Shino, don't go ahead on your own!"
3495,Faust,"Don't raise your voice, Heath. You will awaken the dead."
3496,Heathcliff,"....Ah, yes...."
3497,Nero,"What, are you scared? Did you kill the guys sleeping underneath these grounds?"
3498,Heathcliff,I wouldn't kill anyone.....
3499,Nero,Then there's no need to be afraid.
3500,Faust,"Shino, where are you headed?"
3501,Shino,Isn't that hill also part of the cemetery?
3502,Faust,"It is not. That's the hill of execution, where criminals meet their end. And they are buried nearby."
3503,Heathcliff,The hill of execution...
3504,Shino,What sort of criminals? Like bandits?
3505,Nero,I guess so..... At least they get a proper burial.
3506,Faust,"Bandits, murderers, and.... Those who failed to embody the justice defined by their times."
3507,Shino,Those who failed to embody justice.... You mean failed heroes became criminals?
3508,Faust,That's right.
3509,Shino,Why?
3510,Faust,Why indeed.
3511,Shino,...........
3512,Faust,Let's go. Follow me. Don't leave my side.
3513,Lennox,.........
3514,Rutile,"Mister Lennox, are you having trouble falling asleep?"
3515,Lennox,Rutile.... This place brings back memories.
3516,Rutile,Memories...? Have you been to this castle before?
3517,Lennox,"In the far, distant past."
3518,Rutile,.........
3519,Lennox,"""Let's go. Follow me. Don't leave my side."" -He would say, and continue marching forward. And I would ceaselessly follow his back.... We hoped to reach an ideal future.... Yet why did things turn out this way?"
3520,Rutile,....Mister Lennox..... ....Ah... Is that a portrait.... Of a past king....?
3521,Lennox,"Alec Granvelle. The first king. ....Why did you condemn him - the wizard, your one and only best friend - to be burned at the stake....?"
3522,Narrator,(Hoot hoot)
3523,Akira,The cemetery is scary at night.....
3524,Heathcliff,I agree.....
3525,Shino,"The scariest thing about a midnight cemetery isn't ghosts; it's graverobbers. They'll dig up and sell anything they can find. And if they spot you, they'll bury you alive."
3526,Heathcliff,You've met one before?
3527,Shino,Yeah. I thought he was a man-eating demon when I saw him.
3528,Faust,.....This cemetery might've been visited by some graverobbers too.
3529,Akira,Huh.....
3530,Faust,The whole place has been ravaged.
3531,Nero,You're right.... You can see where they dug things up.
3532,Heathcliff,How could they do something so awful...? When we're all suffering from the < Great Catastrophe > already....
3533,Shino,Here we go....
3534,Heathcliff,Shino! Don't just jump into the grave!
3535,Shino,Look at this. They haven't touched any of the valuables. The pearls and money are still here.
3536,Nero,Then why did they....?
3537,Faust,What about the body?
3538,Akira,....Huh....?
3539,Faust,Is there a corpse inside the coffin?
3540,Shino,I'll check.
3541,Nero,That thing must be heavy. I'll help.
3542,Heathcliff,You're going to open the coffin!? But someone who passed away is resting in there....
3543,Faust,"You're right, Heath. The dead deserve an apology; I'll offer them a prayer. But something is bothering me about this situation. Please check the coffin."
3544,Akira,What's bothering you...?
3545,Faust,"As wizards, we harness mysterious powers derived from sources such as our hearts and natural surroundings. The < Great Catastrophe > is one such source. When it approaches, its mysterious power also grows. It might sound imprudent while the whole world is in danger, but there are many people who aim for that window in time to perform their rituals."
3546,Heathcliff,....You're saying that someone performed a ritual by borrowing the power of the < Great Catastrophe >....?
3547,Faust,That's right.
3548,Narrator,(Rustle)
3549,Shino,...... This thing is.......
3550,Shino,...... This thing is.......
3551,Heathcliff,Wh-what did you find......
3552,Shino,It's empty.
3553,Heathcliff,Empty?
3554,Nero,"There isn't a single bone in this coffin. I'll bet the other graves are the same, too."
3555,Shino,I'll go check a few.
3556,Heathcliff,I... I'll help you guys.
3557,Shino,Don't force yourself. You don't need to touch a single coffin. Just stick to Sir Sage.
3558,Heathcliff,.....Got it.....
3559,Narrator,(Woosh)
3560,Nero,....I don't like the feeling of this wind....
3561,Faust,The spirits are furious. Don't get the wrong idea. We aren't here to trespass on your souls.
3562,Narrator,"The eerie wind continues to blow. Perhaps it's just my imagination - but I see white wisps, shaped like human faces, flying about the cemetery. Faust closes his eyes."
3563,Faust,<< Satillquinart Mullcreed >>
3564,Narrator,"As he quietly murmurs the spell like a prayer, an old mirror appears in his hands. Reflecting the darkness of the night and the light of the moon."
3565,Faust,"Peace, wandering souls. May you find solace in the quiet of night."
3566,Narrator,"The trees of the cemetery continue to shake in mourning. But slowly, the wind quiets down."
3567,Faust,.......
3568,Shino,"Faust. I checked a bunch of coffins, but they were all empty."
3569,Faust,I see.
3570,Nero,Same here. What do I do with these burial treasures?
3571,Faust,Burial treasures?
3572,Nero,"There's a ton of valuable stuff rolling around here, and the owners have headed off to heaven. No reason not to take it, right?"
3573,Faust,.........................
3574,Nero,"Hey, it's a joke, come on."
3575,Faust,It's certainly an ill-natured one.
3576,Heathcliff,"They're going to curse you, Nero!"
3577,Nero,"Sorry, my bad."
3578,Shino,I think Nero is right. I'd rather people give gold to a starving child than leave it to rot with the dead.
3579,Heathcliff,"These are precious items filled with memories belonging to the dead. They should stay with them, even after they pass away. That's why.........."
3580,Narrator,(Clang)
3581,Heathcliff,....Did I just hear something fall?
3582,Faust,"Nero. Jump in place, right now."
3583,Nero,I didn't take anything!
3584,Shino,"Hey, look over there. Wasn't it that collar on the ground?"
3585,Heathcliff,It's a necklace.
3586,Shino,"Right, that necklace."
3587,Faust,"Shino, wait. Don't get close to that thing."
3588,Shino,Why?
3589,Faust,....It wasn't there just a moment ago.
3590,Narrator,"The wind groans as it blows through the cemetery. And the moon shines brighter than ever in the night sky. Like a flower that blossoms as it absorbs the light of the sun, the jewel of necklace grows bright as it basks in the light of the moon. I watch in disbelief as the necklace slowly floats into the air."
3591,Shino,"Watch out, Sage."
3592,Akira,Eh....?
3593,Shino,This happened back in Sherwood Forest too. The amount of power coming from that thing is just creepy.
3594,Faust,"It must be because the < Great Catastrophe > got too close to this world. What had once gone extinct comes back to life; what had once been forgotten remembers its name, and old obsessions that had once been quieted are rekindled. These things absorb the power of the < Great Catastrophe > and blindly run out of control."
3595,Narrator,(Flash)
3596,Akira,....!
3597,Narrator,"In that moment, the necklace unleashes a bright light."
3598,Narrator,(Woosh)
3599,Narrator,"Which illuminates the whole cemetery as we are blasted by a wind as powerful as a hurricane. Just as I'm about to get blown away, Nero takes me into his arms and leaps into the air. We land on the branch of a tree and he peers into my face."
3600,Nero,"Are you ok, Mister Sage?"
3601,Akira,"Nero! Yes I am, thank you!"
3602,Nero,"You're welcome. The higher ups will yell at me if anything happens to you, after all. They're way scarier than that thing over there."
3603,Narrator,"I look down towards the ground through the branches of the tree. The necklace emits a rippling, rainbow-colored light that swells into the shape of a giant eyeball. It's a tremendous, menacing light that looks ready to swallow the entire cemetery. Amidst the merciless waves of light and billowing wind, Shino recites his spell."
3604,Shino,<< Matztzāh Sudipas >>
3605,Narrator,"A giant scythe - unsuited for his height - appears in Shino's hand. The silver light of the blade is menacing and ferocious, yet also pure; it reminds me of Shino himself."
3606,Heathcliff,Shino.....!
3607,Shino,Leave it to me. I'll handle it.
3608,Narrator,"Shino leaps into the ominous light. Like a god of death, he effortlessly swings his scythe around and slices through the light in the blink of an eye. The ominous light emits a screech and grows weaker and weaker. Shino then swings his scythe into the air to crush the last remaining jewel."
3609,Shino,"And we're done. If you were a tamer collar, I'd have offered you as a gift to Mistress. But unfortunately, you were too poorly behaved."
3610,Akira,.........
3611,Narrator,"His scythe cuts through the night wind and reaps the jewel. Which shatters and emits countless beams of light as it disappears into the night. All that remains in its place is Shino's silhouette basked in the moonlight, with the scythe on his shoulder."
3612,Nero,You're pretty amazing.
3613,Narrator,Shino grins proudly in response to Nero's awe.
3614,Shino,"Well, yeah."
3615,Heathcliff,"You're as reckless as ever, Shino......"
3616,Shino,"Hey, can you praise me before you start complaining? A vassal loves and lives to be praised by his lord, you know."
3617,Heathcliff,Where do you learn these sorts of phrases?
3618,Shino,"That's a secret. Hey Faust, you should praise me too. You're a teacher, right?"
3619,Faust,Well done. But you failed to finish the job.
3620,Shino,What do you mean?
3621,Narrator,Faust raises his palm in Shino's direction. And a shard that had been flying straight towards the back of Shino's neck freezes mid-air.
3622,Shino,.......!
3623,Narrator,"Shino turns around in surprise just as Faust snaps his fingers,. The sound echoes through the cemetery and the shard crumbles like sand."
3624,Faust,See?
3625,Shino,...............Tch...........
3626,Heathcliff,Hey. Don't click your tongue. You need to say thank you to Mr. Faust.
3627,Shino,...........Thanks.
3628,Faust,Hah......
3629,Narrator,"Faust releases a short laugh, then turns his narrowed eyes towards the remnants of the jewel being carried away by the wind. He chooses his words quietly and carefully, as if speaking to whatever had been locked within the necklace."
3630,Faust,".....Get lost. No matter how deep your resentment, no matter how furious your rage.... It is no match for mine."
3631,Akira,....Faust...?
3632,Faust,"....... ....I was just speaking to myself. Let's go. We couldn't find the bird's shadow, but this was a worthwhile trip. Sage. I'll leave the rest to you."
3633,Akira,Yes.... Huh!?
3634,Faust,I'm a shut-in. I don't particularly enjoy solving mysteries. Ask the other wizards to figure it out.
3635,Shino,Why? Let's come back tomorrow.
3636,Heathcliff,"I-I want to investigate what's going on, too. Mr. Faust, could you please help us out?"
3637,Faust,What? No.
3638,Nero,"Well, let's report what happened to the higher-ups tomorrow. We're headed home for now."
3639,Shino,.....Got it.
3640,Narrator,"And with that, we leave the cemetery behind."
3641,Narrator,"The next morning, Shino, Heathcliff and I report last night's happenings to Arthur."
3642,Arthur,"Good morning, Sir Sage."
3643,Snow,"Heathcliff, Shino, you're both so early to rise."
3644,White,What good boys you are.
3645,Shino,Don't treat me like a kid.
3646,Heathcliff,"I didn't expect to see you two here as well, Sir Snow and Sir White."
3647,Snow,"Indeed. We wanted to have some morning tea together. We asked Oz to join us too, but he refused."
3648,Arthur,.........
3649,White,"Arthur, no need for you to feel down. I assume he simply doesn't want to face you because he couldn't use his magic last night."
3650,Arthur,"But... It's all due to the injury left by the < Great Catastrophe >; it's not Sir Oz's fault. And are you all right, Heathcliff? You still don't know what your injury is, right?"
3651,Heathcliff,Yes.... And we're still in the dark about Mr. Faust's and Murr's injuries as well.
3652,Shino,"Once we figure out what someone's bizarre injury is, is there any way to cure it?"
3653,Snow,We're currently working on finding a solution. We really have so much to do.
3654,White,"But once we're through with the inauguration ceremony this afternoon, we should have some room to breathe."
3655,Snow,Which involves greeting the citizens down in the square from the castle balcony.
3656,Shino,We get to speak to the crowd from the balcony...? That sounds cool - it's just like what the Lord of Blanchett does. I'm ready to greet them right now.
3657,Arthur,Ahaha. It'll happen soon enough. We're set to greet them at noontime.
3658,White,"Now then, Sage. Why are you here? You came to tell us something, right?"
3659,Akira,"Yes. Last night, when we went to the cemetery...."
3660,Arthur,.....A graverobber?
3661,Heathcliff,That's right. They simply took the corpses without laying a finger on the treasures that lay within the coffins....
3662,Arthur,"I'm also concerned by what you said about the buried treasure being affected by the < Great Catastrophe > drawing too close, as well as the shadow of a giant bird......"
3663,Snow,The shadow of a giant bird....
3664,White,"I feel like I've heard of it before, but perhaps I have not....."
3665,Arthur,Really?
3666,Snow,Hm.... I feel like I almost have it.
3667,White,"When you grow older, your memory just doesn't work the way it used to."
3668,Shino,We can't just wait around hoping that Snow and White will recall anything. I'll help with the investigation. But I want a reward.
3669,Arthur,A reward?
3670,Heathcliff,"Hold it, Shino! I apologize, Prince Arthur. Shino is still a child....."
3671,Shino,"You're the naive child here. Hey, your Highness. I'm a mere servant who has never known his parents. I want something that will gain me the trust of society."
3672,Arthur,I see.... But I cannot be the one to grant you anything.
3673,Shino,Why?
3674,Arthur,"Because if I grant a personal reward to a vassal of the Blanchett family - the great nobles of the East - it'll compromise our diplomatic relations. But I can slip in a word to the royal family of Eastern Country. What is your desire, Shino?"
3675,Shino,"Make me a knight assigned to a general, or the close advisor of a minister."
3676,Heathcliff,....A knight assigned to a general....? Do you plan on leaving Blanchett?
3677,Shino,"Yeah, with you. Heathcliff, you're going to be the general or the minister."
3678,Heathcliff,"Wh-what are you saying, you idiot!? There's no way I could be a general or a minister, and I wouldn't want to, either......"
3679,Shino,"But why? If anyone speaks poorly of a general, he can just chop off their heads. That way, nobody will start rumors about you."
3680,Heathcliff,Listen......
3681,Arthur,"Haha..... I don't know about that reasoning. People speak ill of me, even though I'm a prince. There's really nothing that will shield you from rumors."
3682,Shino,..................
3683,Arthur,"But if all goes well, I will write a letter to the royal family of the East. Is that all right?"
3684,Shino,Yeah. Please.
3685,Heathcliff,Shino......
3686,Narrator,(Door opens)
3687,Nicholas,Excuse me.
3688,Arthur,"Oh, Nicholas. Good timing. There's something I'd like the Magical Technology Corps to investigate. It looks like there was a graverobbing incident at the capital's cemetery-."
3689,Nicholas,A graverobbing incident?
3690,Arthur,Yes. I hear that all the graves were overturned.
3691,Nicholas,"What a fanciful tale you're telling. My subordinates went to the cemetery this morning, and they reported nothing out of the ordinary."
3692,Shino,That can't be true. Last night we saw......
3693,Nicholas,You must have been dreaming. Why were you at the cemetery anyway? The people will get anxious if they find out that wizards have been prowling the cemetery. They'll think you're carrying out suspicious rituals.
3694,Arthur,Don't be rude. The Eastern wizards received a bizarre report from a maid at the castle and went to investigate.
3695,Nicholas,A bizarre report?
3696,Shino,Yes. That the shadow of a giant bird crawled out of the cemetery and destroyed the tower....
3697,Nicholas,The shadow of a giant bird? Haha...... You really went and took the nonsensical ramblings of a young girl for truth.
3698,Shino,..........
3699,Snow,But that goes for your subordinates as well - what were they doing in the cemetery first thing in the morning?
3700,Nicholas,There were several complaints from citizens about a strange light coming from the cemetery in the middle of the night. To think it was all because of you...... All you ever do is create trouble......
3701,Shino,.........
3702,Heathcliff,"Shino, where are you going!?"
3703,Shino,I'm going to check out the cemetery. Those graves were definitely overturned.
3704,Nicholas,Do as you please.
3705,Akira,Please let me go with you.
3706,Shino,"Got it. Come along, then."
3707,Nicholas,How pointless. I've confirmed that there was nothing unusual with my own two eyes. Or would the absence of graverobbers be inconvenient for your purposes?
3708,Shino,What?
3709,Nicholas,"Even Oz, the strongest and most feared wizard in the world, couldn't use his powers in front of the people. We, the Magical Technology Corps, were the ones who repaired the tower gates. This could very well be your attempt to fabricate chaos at the cemetery in order to restore authority to your reputation, could it not?"
3710,Arthur,Nicholas!
3711,Heathcliff,"Mister Nicholas, Captain of the Magical Technology Corps. I too was there to witness the damage wrought by the graverobbers."
3712,Nicholas,...... You're the Blanchett family's.......
3713,Heathcliff,I see you are suggesting that we have disgraced the dead in order to manufacture accomplishments in our name. I will remember that well - especially for the sake of my own country's close ties with Central Country.
3714,Nicholas,.....I offer you my deepest apologies. Please forgive me for my foolish words.
3715,Heathcliff,"Oh, I can't assure you anything; you know very well that people from Eastern Country hold deep grudges."
3716,Nicholas,........ Please excuse me. I'll be taking my leave.
3717,Arthur,Heathcliff. I apologize on behalf of Nicholas.....
3718,Heathcliff,"No, it's all right. Please don't worry about it. Anyway, I'll tag along with you, Shino, Sir Sage."
3719,Shino,Yeah.
3720,Heathcliff,What are you grinning for?
3721,Shino,You were so cool.
3722,Heathcliff,"No I wasn't.... I shouldn't have lost my cool like that; how embarrassing. They're going to call us gloomy, vindictive wizards again."
3723,Snow,We'll accompany you as well.
3724,White,Shall we take our leave?
3725,Akira,This......
3726,Narrator,The cemetery looks undisturbed; there isn't a single trace of the overturned graves. Perhaps someone shoveled the dirt back after we left.
3727,Shino,Let's dig everything up again. The bones might still be gone.
3728,Snow,"Stop it, Shino. If we dig up the graves now, then the people really will start baseless rumors."
3729,Shino,But.....
3730,White,And there's no need to - I can sense that the corpses are gone. Someone must have taken them.
3731,Snow,Something horrible might befall the Central capital soon.
3732,White,How interesting. We should offer a warning to Arthur.
3733,Shino,......
3734,Heathcliff,"Shino, let's go."
3735,Shino,Yeah.
3736,Snow,"Well then, Sage, we will go report the situation to Arthur."
3737,Shino,We'll continue with our own investigation. I'm not letting the Magical Technology Corps steal all the credit.
3738,White,Make sure you come back in time for the inauguration ceremony.
3739,Narrator,(Footsteps)
3740,Drummond,"Sir Sage! Thank goodness, what perfect timing...."
3741,Akira,Mister Drummond.
3742,Drummond,"Please lend us your power! Since the approach of the < Great Catastrophe >, we have received repeated reports of mysterious incidents happening all over the capital! And now there's a possibility that we may have to postpone the inauguration ceremony......"
3743,Shino,Huh? What about waving at everyone from the balcony?
3744,Heathcliff,It looks like there's a problem. Let's be patient and wait.
3745,Shino,"....Fine. That means we can investigate as much as we want without worrying about the time. Let's go, Heath."
3746,Heathcliff,"Shino! I'm sorry, Sir Sage. Please excuse us."
3747,Heathcliff,How are you planning on continuing this investigation anyway?
3748,Shino,"Anything will do, so long as it brings us recognition."
3749,Heathcliff,"Recognition.... Shino, were you serious about making me an Eastern Country general....?"
3750,Shino,Of course I was. You'd never go for a title like that on your own.
3751,Heathcliff,"Shino, you don't know what you're talking about.... If I become a general, what are you going to do if we go to a war with Central Country? It means we'll have to fight against Prince Arthur and Cain."
3752,Shino,"When that happens, I'll seize this entire castle and offer it to you."
3753,Heathcliff,......Shino......
3754,Shino,I'll destroy anything in this world to create a path where you can walk with your head high. I'll steal anything and grant it all to you. Heathcliff Blanchett. You are a man worthy of all this. So do not refuse what I offer you.
3755,Heathcliff,...........
3756,Shino,"You don't need to do anything. I will make you a hero. And when that happens, we can go back to the way we used to be."
3757,Heathcliff,....The way we used to be....?
3758,Shino,......You always used to be so happy whenever I brought you something.
3759,Heathcliff,B-but.... You're talking about flowers and squirrels!?
3760,Shino,A generalship and a castle are the same sort of thing.
3761,Heathcliff,They're not the same!
3762,Shino,"They are the same, because they all suit you. They'll also please Master and Mistress. Anyway, for starters, let's secure our prestige in Central Country. We need to outdo the Magical Technology soldiers who are gloating over repairing the tower gates."
3763,Heathcliff,...........
3764,Akira,Mister Drummond. What do you mean by mysterious incidents.......?
3765,Drummond,"Yes, well.... There have been reports from the capital detailing ancient treasures glowing curiously, and people have been witnessing long-extinct creatures from the distant past....... Amongst the reports, our biggest concern is the dreadful happenings at the Lunar Eclipse Palace......"
3766,Akira,Lunar Eclipse Palace?
3767,Drummond,"It's a palace filled with historic ruins, artifacts, and artwork of incredible academic value collected from all around the world. Many magical tools are stored there for safekeeping as well. According to the curator, you can no longer enter the palace. To be more precise, once you enter the palace, you can never return...... And you see, I haven't been able to contact Cock Robin after he went to check on the palace......"
3768,Akira,You can't reach Mister Cock Robin?
3769,Drummond,"Yes... I asked the Magical Technology Corps to help me out, but they refused, saying they had so much to do..... Sir Sage... He can be rude and careless at times, but he is a precious and hard-working employee of mine. I realize I've been incredibly rude to you and the chosen wizards, but may I ask for your cooperation?"
3770,Akira,.....
3771,Murr,"It's Sir Sage. Heeeey, Sir Sage!"
3772,Akira,Murr... And the Western wizards....
3773,Rustica,"Good morning, Sir Sage. Last night was simply wonderful."
3774,Chloe,It was so fun! I even made a new friend~. I'm going to make her a scarf!
3775,Shylock,What were the two of you discussing?
3776,Akira,"Well...... There have been all kinds of mysterious incidents occurring at this place called the Lunar Eclipse Palace, and Mister Cock Robin seems to have gone missing because of it."
3777,Rustica,He got lost in a palace? It must be quite huge.
3778,Chloe,"He said there were mysterious incidents going on, so maybe it's all under a spell?"
3779,Shylock,"There were many bizarre items in that palace, after all."
3780,Akira,Are you familiar with the palace?
3781,Shylock,"Murr was very fond of it, you see. He would sneak in without permission, browse around without permission, steal items without permission, and also add items without permission."
3782,Drummond,H-he did what with the great artifacts of our country!?
3783,Shylock,"Please direct your complaints at Murr. But you want us to look for the missing Cock Robin, right?"
3784,Drummond,....I do. Could you please save him?
3785,Shylock,"Well, so long as you don't mind relying on these irresponsible, lying wizards."
3786,Drummond,............. Of course not. I beg you.
3787,Shylock,Understood.
3788,Rustica,"I'm sure you must be anxious not knowing what has happened to him. I understand that feeling all too well. For I, too, am looking for my lost bride."
3789,Drummond,....I see. I hope you... Manage to find her.
3790,Rustica,Thank you.
3791,Chloe,You're a nice old guy. Let me help out! We should all work together!
3792,Murr,Yeah! Let's go!
3793,Akira,Oh...... P-please wait! Can I come along too? I'm worried about Mister Cock Robin......
3794,Murr,Sure! Wanna hop on my broom?
3795,Akira,Uh......
3796,Shylock,"Murr, you fly like an acrobat. I'll take you instead, Sir Sage."
3797,Akira,Please! Thank you!
3798,Shylock,The Lunar Eclipse Palace lies just beyond that forest. We'll be there soon enough.
3799,Chloe,The weather is so nice today! It's perfect for flying.
3800,Rustica,"It's also the perfect weather to host a tea party in the garden. We can sing and dance, round and round."
3801,Murr,"Sounds fun! Hey, Sir Sage, do you like to sing?"
3802,Akira,"I'm not very good at it, so...."
3803,Murr,"It doesn't matter whether you're good or bad! The real question is, do you like it or hate it?"
3804,Rustica,"That's right. Sir Sage, if you like something - whether it's singing or dancing - you should enjoy it to your heart's content."
3805,Chloe,"We don't want to have fun with a talented singer - we just want to have fun with you, Sir Sage! If you're enjoying yourself, then so are we!"
3806,Akira,Haha... Then I guess I'll sing the next time you host a tea party.
3807,Chloe,Yay!
3808,Akira,Um... May I ask you all a question?
3809,Shylock,What is it?
3810,Akira,"Why did you accept Mister Drummond's request? Of course I'm worried about Cock Robin. But... Mister Drummond hasn't treated wizards very well up till now. I got the impression that Western wizards were carefree and lived life as they pleased, so I was surprised that you agreed to help him without a word of complaint."
3811,Shylock,"It's very simple. I'm doing it because I decided I wanted to. You are correct when you say that we are not particularly influenced by our surroundings: we do indeed live life as we please. I am interested in the Lunar Eclipse Palace, and I would feel quite terrible letting Cock Robin just die. That's why I took the job; it's simple. However, I am neither driven by a sense of justice; nor by any concern for my reputation. So if I grow tired of this job, I'll simply cast it aside."
3812,Akira,I-I see....
3813,Rustica,"Wizards may live long lives, but it's still a waste to spend your time on things that make you sad or angry."
3814,Chloe,"We're not very good at staying depressed, you see. But we are really good at smiling - even if that might seem a little distorted. We don't want to blame anyone else for our smiles or our tears, so every choice we make is our own; in the end, we're all alone."
3815,Akira,"All alone...? But Chloe, you and Rustica get along so well. The same goes for Murr and Shylock....."
3816,Rustica,"We are lonely beings. For no matter how much time we spend in company - at the end of our lives, we're fated to turn into cold stone all alone. That's why we want to huddle close while we can, and share our warmth with those who are precious to us."
3817,Shylock,"We've arrived at the palace, Sir Sage."
3818,Akira,So this is the Lunar Eclipse Palace......
3819,Chloe,It's kind of dark in here...... I'm getting creepy crawly feelings.....
3820,Shylock,......
3821,Rustica,"What's wrong, Shylock?"
3822,Shylock,I sense Murr's presence.....
3823,Chloe,Murr is right here.
3824,Murr,I'm right here!
3825,Shylock,"Yes, you're right.... Don't mind me. Let's go."
3826,Narrator,(Creaking)
3827,Narrator,"Shylock opens the door, and we are greeted with the interior of an old, Western-style building. A curious atmosphere hangs about the place; artifacts I've never seen before are lined up all around the room. As I walk around marveling at everything I see, a butterfly comes flitting our way. It flutters through the air, covered in glittering dust that sparkles as its wings shift between colors - one moment purple; the next, yellow."
3828,Chloe,What's with that butterfly....?
3829,Rustica,It's strange but beautiful.
3830,Narrator,"The butterfly gently lands on Rustica's shoulder. And in an instant, it swells to the size of a horse carriage. Its long, straw-like tongue slithers and wriggles back and forth as it attacks Rustica."
3831,Akira,Rustica.....!
3832,Rustica,<< Amorest Viesse >>
3833,Narrator,"Without losing a second, Rustica raises the birdcage that he always carries with him. The giant butterfly shrinks right before our eyes, sucked straight into the birdcage."
3834,Rustica,"Phew, that was surprising...."
3835,Chloe,"Are you okay, Rustica!?"
3836,Rustica,I'm fine. But now I know that a butterfly has a terrifying face upon close inspection. It'll probably turn up in my nightmares tonight.
3837,Chloe,"Geez, Rustica, you're always so laid back."
3838,Narrator,"I breathe a sigh of relief. But then I frown, noticing that butterfly scales continue to shimmer and flutter around us. Even though the butterfly has already vanished, the glittering scales increase steadily in number - to the point where I start to feel suffocated. Then I realize that the scales have surrounded us."
3839,Shylock,Don't move.
3840,Narrator,"I nod and nervously hold my breath. Shylock puts his pipe to his mouth, and slowly blows out a cloud of white smoke. Enveloped by the smoke, the glittering scales begin to spin around and radiate light like a disco ball. The scales continue to emit light as they gather into what looks like a giant face. The face peers into mine, and laughter rings through my ears."
3841,Narrator,(Demonic laugh)
3842,Butterfly scales,Gyahahahaha!
3843,Akira,......!
3844,Narrator,I feel my head spinning at this series of incomprehensible events.
3845,Shylock,Shh.......
3846,Narrator,"Shylock places his index finger on my lips, and I desperately clamp my mouth shut. He puts his pipe to his mouth again, and leisurely breathes out a long stream of smoke. At that moment......"
3847,Murr,Wah!!
3848,Akira,Gyaaah!
3849,Narrator,"Startled by Murr, I let out a resounding scream."
3850,Narrator,(More demonic laughter)
3851,Butterfly scales,Gyahahahaha!!
3852,Narrator,"The laughing face made of scales turns toward me, and closes in from above my head. Just as I am about to be swallowed by its giant, gaping mouth- A large, polka-dot patterned cloth wraps around me, as if protecting me."
3853,Chloe,<< Suispicibo Voitengok >> !
3854,Akira,.........!
3855,Narrator,"In an instant, the polka-dot patterned cloth turns into a raincoat, fitting itself perfectly on my body. But as soon as the glittering scales fall onto the raincoat, it glows with a blue flame and dissipates into cinders. In the meantime, Shylock banishes the glittering scales with the smoke from his pipe. I instinctively pat my body down, but I don't seem to be burnt anywhere."
3856,Akira,Wh-What was that?
3857,Chloe,"A temporary protective spell. You're not hurt anywhere, right?"
3858,Akira,"Yes, I'm all right. Thank you."
3859,Narrator,"Chloe beams cheerfully. Pipe still in his mouth, Shylock narrows his eyes and glares into the darkness."
3860,Shylock,Stop with this puerile prank right now. Come on out.
3861,Akira,"What do you mean, come on out? Is there someone else in this room?"
3862,Shylock,"Oh, yes. In fact, he's a wizard with a terrible personality who makes a hobby out of provoking others....."
3863,???,"Oh dear, what a nasty description."
3864,Akira,......!
3865,Narrator,"We all look up in astonishment at the voice echoing from the darkness. I've heard that voice before. The darkness flickers, and takes the shape of a human. And Shylock swallows his breath."
3866,Shylock,....Don't tell me.....
3867,???,"It's been ages since we last met, yet you insult me so coldly. I don't dislike that about you, though."
3868,Narrator,"A presence slowly steals closer. The dark human-shaped silhouette takes his hat in hand, and sweeps it into a gentlemanly bow. Before us-"
3869,Chloe,Huh....!?
3870,Rustica,Oh?
3871,Murr,Eh?
3872,Narrator,There stands another Murr.
3873,???,Welcome to the Lunar Palace.
3874,Narrator,"Grinning broadly, the other Murr snaps his fingers. And then-"
3875,Narrator,(Flash of light)
3876,Narrator,"We are drawn into an infinite, spiraling vortex in space."
3877,Akira,.......!
3878,Mithra,"Please give me one of those. Ah... and one of these, too."
3879,Central town shopkeeper,"Mister Sage's Wizard, um...... I need payment....."
3880,Mithra,Did you just make a demand?
3881,Central town shopkeeper,...........
3882,Mithra,"If we were in the North, I would have killed you already. How would you like that?"
3883,Central town shopkeeper,P-please take everything you need!
3884,Mithra,"Oh, thanks."
3885,Rutile,Mister Mithra!
3886,Mithra,....Who are you?
3887,Rutile,I'm the Southern wizard Rutile. This is my little brother Mitile.
3888,Mitile,Hello.....
3889,Mithra,Okay.....
3890,Rutile,Were you shopping?
3891,Mithra,"Yes, because I was bored. You see, I need to be careful about what I do, or else Oz will come after me. It's such a pain. Do you have business with me?"
3892,Rutile,"Um..... You're Uncle Mithra, right?"
3893,Mithra,Uncle Mithra.
3894,Rutile,"We met once when I was a child. Do you remember me? You said you were my mother's friend, and she introduced you as ""Uncle Mithra."" You gave us an artifact resembling a monkey's arm..."
3895,Mithra,"A monkey's arm? A vanara arm is a powerful talisman, but you're saying I gave you one?"
3896,Rutile,Yes. When Mitile was still in our mother's stomach.
3897,Mithra,Huh.....
3898,Rutile,"Ah, I forgot to tell you the most important part. Our mother was a witch, and her name was...."
3899,Mithra,I don't care. Since I don't remember.
3900,Rutile,.....Ah.......
3901,Mithra,Please get out of my way.
3902,Rutile,S-sorry for taking up your time.....
3903,Narrator,(Footsteps)
3904,Mitile,.......... What's with him? He's so rude....
3905,Rutile,"Sorry, Mitile. It looks like it was a misunderstanding on my part."
3906,Mitile,"There's no way we'd know a Northern wizard. Mother was a great witch, after all."
3907,Rutile,"There you go again. You know, there are lots of good things about the Northern wizards, too."
3908,Central town shopkeeper,"Hey, you there. Do you know that guy?"
3909,Rutile,"Huh? Ah, yes......"
3910,Central town shopkeeper,Great! Can you pay for everything he gobbled up?
3911,Rutile,...............
3912,Mitile,He's the worst!
3913,Rutile,"H.... Hey, don't say that. Maybe he just didn't know how to buy groceries. What's the total? I'll pay you."
3914,Mitile,You're too kind! Our reputation is tanking because the Northern wizards do whatever they want.
3915,Figaro,"Hey, Rutile, Mitile."
3916,Rutile,"Dr. Figaro... and Mister Lennox, too. What are you two doing here?"
3917,Lennox,We were asked to help fix up the city. Apparently there's been a series of bizarre events that slowed down the reconstruction work. We're also keeping an eye on him.......
3918,Mitile,Him?
3919,Bradley,Tch..... The twins said I could reduce my sentence by doing volunteer work. I'm only helping you so I can get released as soon as possible.
3920,Rutile,Mister Bradley.
3921,Mitile,...... Another Northern wizard.....
3922,Akira,.............
3923,Narrator,Burning stars hurtle through the vast expanse of infinitely sprawling darkness. I plunge downwards through outer space. No - I could be floating upwards for all I know.
3924,Akira,Where is everyone? Where are you guys......!?
3925,Narrator,"I reach out blindly, besieged by terror at the thought of wandering through the stars alone. And someone grabs my hand."
3926,Murr,............
3927,Akira,Murr....!
3928,Narrator,"My relief is short-lived; from the smile on Murr's face, I can tell that he is not the Murr I know. His intelligent gaze cuts like a knife, and his gentlemanly smile hides his true identity like a perfect magic trick."
3929,Murr,"Pardon me, Sir Sage. It looks like my surprise was a bit much for you."
3930,Narrator,"Murr takes my hand as if inviting me to dance. Still bewildered, I tighten my grip on his hand. I'm scared of wandering this space all alone, so I don't want to let go. Even if I don't know who he really is. I remember the Murr that I met in the elevator on the day I first arrived in this world. ""Both the world and I have been torn apart quite terribly..."" ""But I want you to discover the truth about this world."""
3931,Akira,......Are you the Murr I met in the elevator......?
3932,Narrator,"Murr smirks, the corners of his lips turned upwards."
3933,Murr,"No, this is the first time we've met. I've always been here, in the Lunar Eclipse Palace. I was quite fond of this place, after all. Herein lie the treasures of the ancient past - from the earliest days of civilization - left by wizards and humans alike. There is a shard of my dearest beloved, too."
3934,Akira,A shard of your dearest beloved....?
3935,Murr,A shard of the moon.... A moonstone. A small meteorite that arrived from the < Great Catastrophe >.
3936,Akira,The < Great Catastrophe >......? The < Great Catastrophe > is your dearest beloved?
3937,Murr,Indeed. I am in love with it.
3938,Narrator,"I gaze at Murr intently. As I observe him closely, I realize that he has a different air to him than the Murr I first met in the elevator. He's a bit more provocative, and a bit more arrogant."
3939,Akira,Who are you?
3940,Murr,"I am the Western wizard Murr. People called me a philosopher, a genius, a brilliant inventor.... I have many titles, but my favorite is this - ""The troublemaker Murr, who fell in love with the moon and destroyed himself"" - it's what Shylock called me. It sounds like the title of a comedy.... Or an epitaph."
3941,Narrator,"I don't understand any of it - what the Murr in front of me is saying, whether he's a good person or a bad person. But when his eyes, like burning stars, gaze into mine, I feel like they're sucking me in."
3942,Akira,....Who are you....?
3943,Murr,Don't ask the same question twice; that's boring. Try a different approach. You can find the answer.
3944,Akira,....You're a different person than the Murr I was with? Or are you the real Murr?
3945,Murr,"Both answers are right, and also wrong."
3946,Akira,...I don't understand....
3947,Murr,Think. I love observing people's faces as they think.
3948,Narrator,Murr touches my face and smiles delightedly.
3949,Murr,"They freeze, as if in temporary death; yet they're busy thinking round and round in their minds and hearts. It's quite serene, raw, and beautiful. Just as the cold light of a star is actually burning at a temperature far too hot to approach - intellect burns with intensity. So please, Sir Sage. Approach my identity with the beloved feeling of yearning so hard for the truth that it consumes one's body."
3950,Narrator,I purse my lips at Murr's delight.
3951,Akira,"...The Murr I was with up till now was quite strange, but you are plenty strange too...."
3952,Murr,"What great praise. If I'm the same as anyone else, there's no reason for me to be alive."
3953,Narrator,"Murr shrugs, and I desperately try to rack my brain. What did Shylock say? I've heard many stories about Murr from him. Murr is an intelligent gentleman. The inventor of magical technology. But he got too close to the secret of the < Great Catastrophe >, and.... His soul shattered to pieces."
3954,Akira,....Are you a piece of Murr's shattered soul....?
3955,Narrator,"In high spirits, Murr takes my hand and dances us around in a circle."
3956,Murr,"Excellent! I am one of the many pieces of Murr's shattered soul, which lie all over the world. I fell here, without manifesting any particular form. But the day the < Great Catastrophe > approached - for some reason, I managed to take this physical shape. The beautiful < Great Catastrophe > affects everything it approaches. I see it came quite close this time. And Murr fought the < Great Catastrophe >; that may be why his body was affected by it, causing the shards of his soul to take physical form."
3957,Akira,The shards of his soul take physical form... So this is Murr's bizarre injury....
3958,Murr,Bizarre injury. That's an interesting phrase. I'm quite fond of it.
3959,Akira,"Um... So, there are Murrs like you all over the world - if we gather them all, will Murr return to his former self?"
3960,Murr,Perhaps. But I can't say I like the idea. Murr is too intelligent; his brain can never stay in one place. I would like to remain immersed in my own research. Is that a problem?
3961,Akira,I don't think I can answer that question for you.....
3962,Murr,I see. To whom do you think I should make my demands known? Do soul shards have human rights?
3963,Akira,W... Why did you kidnap Mister Cock Robin? Because you didn't want him to get in the way of your research?
3964,Murr,I didn't kidnap him. I simply stopped him from wandering further into the palace. Because therein lie the traces of a powerful spell.
3965,Akira,A powerful spell?
3966,Murr,"Yes. An unsuccessful invocation has lost its harmony and is now changing form. They used the moonstone as a medium - some old human bones wouldn't really suffice as a proper sacrifice. To top it off, the person who carried out the ritual wielded no magic."
3967,Akira,W-what does that mean? Please speak in simpler terms....
3968,Narrator,"Murr narrows his eyes like a cat, smiling enigmatically."
3969,Murr,"People tried to beckon the < Great Catastrophe > to draw close - presumably, people all over the world. This is merely one part of a greater summoning circle."
3970,Akira,Beckon the < Great Catastrophe >....?
3971,Narrator,Murr merely continues to smile. I am confused. Everyone so far told me the same thing: that the world will be destroyed when the < Great Catastrophe > comes close. Yet....
3972,Akira,"You mean someone was trying to beckon the < Great Catastrophe >, and that's what caused all this damage? But it's going to cause the end of the world - why would they do this....?"
3973,Murr,"Unfortunately, I don't have the answer to that. Perhaps another Murr could tell you, but all I know of is the tragedy that is about to follow."
3974,Akira,Tragedy....
3975,Murr,"The invocation that was carried out here.... In other words, the summoning of the moon failed, and it is transforming into an entirely different spell. Didn't the Umbra Volans1 make an appearance? The elderly twins from the North should know about it well. But they are getting quite old, so perhaps their memory is deteriorating."
3976,Shylock,-Let go of his hand.
3977,Narrator,"Suddenly, a pipe is laid against Murr's neck. Murr simply glances over his shoulder. Shylock stands there behind him, Chloe and Rustica following a beat later."
3978,Rustica,"Sir Sage, are you all right!?"
3979,Chloe,Is that man...... The other Murr we saw just moments ago!?
3980,Narrator,Murr shows no sign of panicking; he merely glances sideways at Shylock and laughs.
3981,Murr,"Hello, Shylock. It's certainly been a while. The scent of your pipe reminds me of the times we spent all night in argument."
3982,Shylock,It has certainly been a while since I last saw such a garrulous Murr. You must be a piece of Murr's soul.
3983,Murr,Indeed. What are you going to do with me?
3984,Shylock,I'm going to retrieve you and return you to Murr.
3985,Murr,"Really? My dear friend Shylock, do you really want to do such a thing?"
3986,Shylock,...What do you mean?
3987,Murr,"I thought you were quite fond of him. The innocent and simple-minded me, who rolls around like a stray cat."
3988,Shylock,..........
3989,Murr,"He won't talk down to you; he won't insult you. He'll listen to your every command. The foolish and adorable Murr, who belongs only to you. You loved me, and you loathed me. Of course you're fond of him."
3990,Narrator,Shylock's face stiffens at Murr's grin.
3991,Shylock,"....Oh loathsome Murr. But if you are going to call me a friend, I do wish you would understand me a bit better."
3992,Murr,"I believe I do understand you. You wanted to stop me from inventing magical science technology. But I refused. And as a result, your hometown was contaminated. The creatures went extinct, and the waves ceased to echo across the shores. Of course you loathe me. But you are surprisingly obsessive, so you could not cast away your affection for me. That is why you continue to think of me in conflict - the conflict that you so adore. You loathe me and you love me. You blame me and you forgive me. You pity me, and you think of me nostalgically. Am I wrong?"
3993,Narrator,"Shylock smiles. He slowly brings the mouthpiece of his pipe to his lips, a vein popping on his forehead."
3994,Shylock,I am merely saying that I would only like to defeat you after you return to your full strength.
3995,Murr,"You're a fool. If I return to my former self, you wouldn't stand a chance. Because I'm stronger and smarter than you. Isn't that why you hated me?"
3996,Shylock,<< Invibelle >>
3997,Narrator,"Shylock casts his spell like a whisper of love, and Murr is enveloped in smoke. His body begins to turn purple, as if it has been poisoned. Shylock watches with freezing cold eyes as Murr's body transforms grotesquely."
3998,Shylock,"You know, I always did think that you needed a proper education in good taste."
3999,Murr,"Ah, ah. Ah....."
4000,Shylock,Do not fear. I will give the new Murr a fine teaching.
4001,Narrator,"Shylock relentlessly blows more smoke towards Murr, even as he continues to writhe in agony."
4002,Rustica,Sh-Shylock... Isn't this a bit much.... It makes me want to close my eyes....
4003,Shylock,Then why don't you look away?
4004,Murr,"Ah, ah......"
4005,Shylock,<< Invibelle >>
4006,Chloe,"Y-you really aren't holding back.... Shylock, are you mad....?"
4007,Shylock,It's just as this man said.
4008,Narrator,Shylock huffs out a breath of smoke and quietly closes his eyes.
4009,Shylock,"I have always been furious at Murr, and I have always wanted to get my revenge. All while thinking of him more belovedly than anyone else."
4010,Narrator,"Still struggling, Murr - now entirely discolored - starts to melt and lose his shape. Before long, he turns into a small shard of purple sapphire. As the shard drops to the floor, we find ourselves back in the Western-style building."
4011,Akira,.......
4012,Chloe,"Phew... Thank goodness we're back.... So Murr's soul shard made that weird space, huh...."
4013,Shylock,That seems to be the case.
4014,Narrator,"Shylock picks up the shard lying on the floor as if it is something precious. Then we hear a voice calling out for us, and Murr appears on his broom."
4015,Murr,We were in space! Did you guys see?
4016,Chloe,"We did! But more importantly, Murr, you were in huge trouble."
4017,Murr,Trouble?
4018,Shylock,Everything is all right now. Open your mouth.
4019,Narrator,Shylock offers him the shard of purple sapphire. Murr obediently opens his mouth.
4020,Murr,Ah.
4021,Shylock,Murr.
4022,Murr,Ye~s?
4023,Shylock,How do you feel about me?
4024,Narrator,Murr closes his mouth and responds without hesitation.
4025,Murr,I love you!
4026,Narrator,"Shylock finally smiles, then puts the soul shard into Murr's mouth. Murr swallows the shard and Shylock gently pats his head."
4027,Shylock,I love you too.
4028,Murr,Yay~!
4029,Rustica,Haha. How precious.
4030,Chloe,"Do you really think so....? Personally, it's getting to my stomach after the grotesque scene back there....."
4031,Rustica,"They've lived long lives, you see; that's why their friendship is just a bit extreme."
4032,Chloe,"Rustica, you've lived a long life too, right...? Let's make our friendship not-so-extreme, please....?"
4033,Rustica,I'll do my best. Murr. Did eating that shard help you remember anything?
4034,Narrator,"Murr blinks a few times, and lifts his right hand, where he wears his ring."
4035,Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
4036,Cock Robin,Woah......!!
4037,Akira,Mister Cock Robin!
4038,Narrator,"Murr recites his spell, and Mister Cock Robin appears in the previously empty space."
4039,Narrator,Mister Cock Robin takes one look at Murr's face and screams.
4040,Cock Robin,Stop! Don't kill me!
4041,Shylock,"Don't worry. The person who trapped you was Murr, but it was also not Murr."
4042,Cock Robin,Wh-what do you mean?
4043,Akira,He said he trapped you so that you wouldn't head into the back of the palace. He did it to save you.
4044,Cock Robin,"I... I see. I thought I would be stuck in there forever. Thank you, Sir Sage."
4045,Akira,Please say that to them. I wasn't the one who saved you - they were.
4046,Cock Robin,"Ah... Thank you, Sage's wizards."
4047,Chloe,"No worries! More importantly, do you remember what happened?"
4048,Cock Robin,"Um, let me see...... The curator of the Lunar Eclipse Palace asked me to look into things, so that's why I was exploring the place by myself."
4049,Rustica,That's amazing. You must be a very brave person.
4050,Narrator,"At Rustica's praise, Cock Robin blushes and scratches his head."
4051,Cock Robin,"N-no, not at all! I'm actually very timid. But you let me ride on your brooms, and when I flew through the sky.... I felt like a different person - I wanted to become someone else... Ah, sorry! That was a tangent. In any case, when I was looking around, I saw a creepy, eerie door. And when I tried to open it-..... Murr appeared, and blasted me off into a place that looked like outer space, and I had been floating around ever since."
4052,Chloe,That sounds like a lot. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
4053,Shylock,"A creepy, eerie door... Could you take us there?"
4054,Cock Robin,"Yes, of course."
4055,Cain,....Phew. I'm finally back at the castle. The < Great Catastrophe > caused so much trouble - there's weird stuff going on all over the capital.
4056,Central Country soldier,"Welcome back, General Cain."
4057,Cain,Woah... H-hey there.
4058,Central Country soldier,....? Are you all right? Perhaps you need to get some rest.
4059,Cain,"Sorry, my eyes haven't been doing so well lately."
4060,Central Country soldier,That's terrible...! Let's get you to a doctor immediately...!
4061,Cain,"Nah, it's no big deal. But... Could you hold my hand?"
4062,Central Country soldier,Hold... your hand....?
4063,Cain,Yeah. For just a moment.
4064,Central Country soldier,"The hero, General Cain's hand... The hand of the former leader of the Order of Knights and the greatest warrior in all of Central... I'm sure I will be blessed by a goddess!"
4065,Cain,"No, it's not that big a deal...."
4066,Central Country soldier,"But excuse me for one second, my nails are soiled! Let me wash my hands first....!"
4067,Cain,"It's fine, it's fine. Here."
4068,Central Country soldier,Ah.....
4069,Cain,"Ah, I can finally see you."
4070,Central Country soldier,General Cain's hand... Is so big......
4071,Cain,"Well, sure. How is the Order of Knights holding up after the attack of the < Great Catastrophe >? Even the Sage's wizards had a lot of trouble fighting it this year, and it caused some horrible damages and losses. Were you guys all right?"
4072,Central Country soldier,"Yes. It was all thanks to your training, General Cain...."
4073,Nicholas,What are you doing? Return to your position.
4074,Central Country soldier,Yes sir....!
4075,Cain,He was talking to me.
4076,Nicholas,Show some deference to your superiors.
4077,Cain,"He was talking to me, Sir Nicholas, leader of the Order of Knights - no, captain of the Magical Technology Corps, I guess."
4078,Nicholas,You taking my spot as the leader of the Order of Knights is already a story of the past. I hear they stripped you of your position and kicked you out after they discovered you were a wizard. No wonder your sword wielding skills were out of this world.
4079,Cain,I don't recall using magic when I fought you.
4080,Nicholas,What did I say about deference?
4081,Cain,"....Sir. But you're weird, too. I remember how much you hated magic. Why did you join the Magical Technology Corps?"
4082,Nicholas,.......You would never understand.
4083,Cain,Huh?
4084,Nicholas,Stop acting like you still have any connection to the Central knights. You're already a wizard and an outsider.
4085,Nicholas,Wizards can manipulate any heart and steal their way past any door. They could easily get their hands on national secrets.
4086,Cain,What are you suggesting? Are you trying to say I'd betray this country?
4087,Nicholas,Wizards make organizations fall apart. They aren't suited to knighthood. There's no place for you within this castle anymore. Stop taking advantage of Prince Arthur's kindness. Take your comrades and leave this castle.
4088,Cain,You.....! ......! Head down!
4089,Nicholas,.......!?
4090,Narrator,(Crash)
4091,Owen,Oh dear? Why did you protect him?
4092,Cain,Owen.....!
4093,Owen,I was going to kill him for you.
4094,Nicholas,You....!
4095,Cain,Run. You don't stand a chance against him.
4096,Nicholas,"Shut up! Get down here, Northern wizard Owen! Get on your knees, and show me what's inside your bag!"
4097,Owen,My bag?
4098,Nicholas,Yes. You might be bringing suspicious items into the castle.
4099,Owen,"I mean, sure. But the moment I open this bag, you're dead."
4100,Nicholas,.........
4101,Cain,"Go. I mean, please go. I'll hold him off....."
4102,Nicholas,.....You monsters....!
4103,Narrator,(Footsteps)
4104,Cain,............
4105,Owen,"Ahaha. Even though you protected him. He insulted the both of us together. Humans simply see us as the same kind of monster, my gentle knight."
4106,Cain,We aren't the same.
4107,Owen,We're the same. Ahaha....!
4108,Cain,....He disappeared..... ......Dammit......!
4109,Central Country man,"Excuse me, could you help me move this rubble?"
4110,Lennox,Certainly.
4111,Bradley,Dammit. Why the hell does the great Bradley have to do volunteer work?
4112,Figaro,"Now now, no whining. You don't want to go back to prison, right? You should be grateful for your freedom."
4113,Mitile,"Dr. Figaro, could you help me out here?"
4114,Figaro,I'm headed over right now~.
4115,Bradley,".....Why the hell are you being all friendly with the Southern wizards, Northern wizard Figaro? If you wanted to, you could make everyone here your slave. Why are you helping these powerless humans?"
4116,Figaro,"Because I like humans. Also, I've kept my origins a secret from those two. I'll punish you if you let it slip, Bradley."
4117,Bradley,Tch......
4118,Figaro,"All right, I'm headed off. Ask Lennox for further instructions. Leno, take care of him."
4119,Lennox,Got it. Bradley. Can you take the rubble to the other side of the plaza? Make sure you don't hurt anyone.
4120,Bradley,"Dammit, what a pain..... There! Are you satisfied?"
4121,Narrator,(Clatter)
4122,Lennox,Yes. Thank you.
4123,Bradley,Hmph.... You're not as strong as Figaro. What would you do if I killed you and ran away?
4124,Lennox,That would be a problem.
4125,Bradley,That's all you have to say!?
4126,Lennox,I mean... It would be a big problem.
4127,Bradley,Hmph.
4128,Lennox,Please keep working. You can help everyone out by clearing this path.
4129,Bradley,Stop acting all nice. I'll let you in on something good. Absent-minded guys like you are the ones who end up attacking women and children when it comes down to it. You get so excited that you don't even know what you're doing.
4130,Lennox,..........
4131,Bradley,"Hmph. Did I make you mad? Bet I hit the mark. I had lots of underlings, after all. Hey, say something."
4132,Lennox,You really like to talk.
4133,Bradley,Aaah!?
4134,Lennox,I'm sorry. I'm not very good at talking. It takes me a while to gather my thoughts.... Rutile complains about this all the time.
4135,Bradley,.......You really are absent-minded. You just took the fun out of it.
4136,Lennox,I see.
4137,Bradley,Yeah.
4138,Lennox,Please keep working.
4139,Bradley,"Shut up, you already said that! Geez...."
4140,Narrator,(Footsteps)
4141,Central Country child,"Mister Wizard, thank you for helping us out! This bread is from Mother....."
4142,Lennox,Thank - ah......
4143,Bradley,I'm working harder than you. So I get to eat it.
4144,Lennox,"Oh, so you were hungry?"
4145,Bradley,Yeah.
4146,Lennox,"I see. It's easy to get frustrated when you're hungry, isn't it."
4147,Bradley,"I wasn't whining because I was hungry! Geez, Southern wizards are so slow.... Hmph... He bakes better bread, but this isn't bad."
4148,Central Country child,.............
4149,Bradley,What are you looking at? I'm gonna eat you too.
4150,Central Country child,Waaaah........
4151,Lennox,Don't threaten a young child.... Thank you. Say thanks to your mother for me.
4152,Central Country child,Yes.......
4153,Narrator,(Footsteps)
4154,Mitile,Hey! Why are you bullying him!
4155,Lennox,Mitile.
4156,Bradley,The hell's with you? Want me to make you cry too?
4157,Mitile,I... I can't have you making all of us wizards look bad.
4158,Bradley,"Well, that's not my problem. The only ones who'd wind up in trouble are weak goody-two-shoes like you. You're weak, but you're still stronger than humans. Why do you go around sucking up to them?"
4159,Mitile,I'm not sucking up to anyone! I just want everyone to get along....
4160,Bradley,"Why does everyone need to get along? We can live on our own. If a town gets covered in rubble, then you just need to look for a new one that's not. Why the hell do we have to do this pain-in-the-ass kinda work? Just find a better town and make that your territory."
4161,Mitile,This is where everyone here has lived up till now. They're all attached to this place.
4162,Bradley,That's everyone else. Not me.
4163,Mitile,We should help each other out in times of trouble! So that we can all live together....
4164,Bradley,"What's the deal with ""everyone""? Why do you need everyone to get along?"
4165,Mitile,Most people like being with others. Most people want to be loved; we don't want to be hated! I guess it's different for Northern wizards!
4166,Bradley,Yeah. I don't get it. Why do you want people to love you? Why are you so afraid of being hated?
4167,Mitile,That's.....
4168,Bradley,You don't know? Then you're the same as me.
4169,Mitile,..........
4170,Bradley,"Hmph. How pointless. You don't even know why you're all hung up on ""everyone, everyone"" in the first place."
4171,Mitile,.......When I..........
4172,Bradley,"...What now, you're gonna cry? This is why I hate kids....."
4173,Lennox,Bradley. Stop it.
4174,Mitile,"When I become a powerful wizard, I'll definitely defeat you......."
4175,Bradley,............
4176,Mitile,"I'll definitely, definitely beat you up!!"
4177,Bradley,....Hah. Hahah! I like that!
4178,Mitile,What's so funny!?
4179,Bradley,"Wanting to beat up the guys who piss you off - that's the kind of logic I can follow. Much better than ""let's all get along."" Hey, you Southern brat. You might actually get by pretty well in the North."
4180,Mitile,......I'd never go to the North! Don't lump me in with bad guys like you!
4181,Figaro,"Mitile, what's wrong?"
4182,Mitile,"Dr. Figaro..... This Northern wizard keeps saying awful, senseless things....."
4183,Figaro,"There, there. Northern wizards sure are awful~. Dr. Figaro will protect you."
4184,Bradley,"Dammit, Figaro... You two-faced bastard....."
4185,Lennox,"Now that you've eaten, we should keep working. Come on."
4186,Bradley,"Don't drag me around! Listen up, you're not allowed to order me around! I get to decide what I'll do next....."
4187,Lennox,"Got it. Then please, lead us along. First, say thanks for the meal."
4188,Bradley,"Thanks for the meal.... Hey, what the fuck, are you picking a fight with me!?"
4189,Figaro,"Geez, what a fuss. Mitile, everything's all right now."
4190,Mitile,Dr. Figaro....
4191,Figaro,What is it?
4192,Mitile,I want to get stronger.... I want to become a powerful wizard. Please teach me powerful magic.
4193,Figaro,......
4194,Mitile,"If I were powerful, Mister Bradley would've listened to what I had to say. Because what I'm saying is correct! Because it's what nii-sama and Dr. Figaro taught me - it's what's right for everyone's sake! That's why I want to get stronger, Dr. Figaro. Why won't you teach me powerful magic? Do I not have any talent....?"
4195,Figaro,"That's not true. Mitile, you're still young. You don't need to sweat it."
4196,Mitile,But......
4197,Figaro,"Plus, Mitile, do you really want to become stronger in order to help everyone else?"
4198,Mitile,Huh....?
4199,Figaro,"Are you sure it's not for your own sake, because Bradley beat you in an argument? When you say ""for everyone's sake,"" is Bradley included in that?"
4200,Mitile,.........
4201,Figaro,"Calm down and think about it. If you force your selfish desires onto everyone in the name of justice, that would make you no different from a dictator who executes whoever he wants on a whim. I understand that you're frustrated because Bradley won that argument. But that's why you should look for words that will reach him next time. You don't need to be powerful to do that."
4202,Mitile,.....Yes.....
4203,Figaro,"Ah, look. Rutile is over there. He looks troubled. You should go help him out."
4204,Mitile,....I see. I'll head on over.
4205,Figaro,"Yes, see you later. ........ What to do.... So Mitile realized that I was deliberately avoiding teaching him powerful magic. Mitile. I'm sorry, but that's something I can never teach you."
4206,Snow,Was it all right for us to force the Southern wizards to keep an eye on Bradley?
4207,White,"Figaro is with them, so I'm sure they'll be fine. And nothing strange seems to be happening with the child of the prophecy for now."
4208,Snow,The prophecy we saw before Tiretta died.
4209,Snow & White,Our prophecies are never wrong.
4210,Snow,We prophesied that the next child born from Tiretta would annihilate all the Southern wizards.
4211,White,"In truth, the great witch Tiretta died when he was born."
4212,Snow,"Now, now, let's see how this goes. We don't know if the prophecy will come to pass in ten years, or in a hundred...."
4213,Mitile,Nii-sama....? Huh? Who's that child?
4214,Rutile,He helped me with some restoration work. But now I'm being bombarded with questions....
4215,Skinny Central Country child,"Hey, how do I become a wizard? Can I use magic too?"
4216,Mitile,....You want to be a wizard?
4217,Skinny Central Country child,"Yeah! Because if I could use magic, I could do lots of things, and I'd never have to look for work."
4218,Rutile,Humans can't become wizards. It's the sort of thing that's decided the moment you're born.
4219,Skinny Central Country child,But I heard there's a way for humans to use magic too!
4220,Rutile,"I guess you're talking about magical technology from the West? I don't know much about that, you see. .....Huh? Your stomach's all swelled up. What's wrong? Are you keeping something under your clothes?"
4221,Skinny Central Country child,It's a part of my job! I'm taking care of an important package.
4222,Mitile,It looks heavy. Do you need help?
4223,Skinny Central Country child,"I'm fine! Mister Mithra, the Sage's wizard, asked me to take care of it."
4224,Rutile,Mister Mithra....?
4225,Skinny Central Country child,"Ah, I just remembered I have something to do! I need to go! Bye-bye....!"
4226,Rutile,Ah.....
4227,Narrator,(Footsteps)
4228,Rutile,Mister Mithra.... What did he ask such a young child to do?
4229,Skinny Central Country child,"Ah, there he is. Mister Mithra!"
4230,Mithra,........
4231,Skinny Central Country child,"I met the Sage's wizards! And just as you said, nobody realized what was going on! But it's getting bigger! Look....."
4232,Mithra,Don't remove your clothes. I told you not to show that to anyone.
4233,Skinny Central Country child,"S-sorry.... .....Hey, if I do what you say, will you really give this to me? Isn't it an incredible treasure?"
4234,Mithra,Of course I will.
4235,Skinny Central Country child,"Yay! If I sell this, I'll be rich! It's so beautiful...... A jewel that's shining like the moon!"
4236,Akira,"So this is the back of the palace... Mister Cock Robin, is this the room you tried to enter before you were stopped?"
4237,Cock Robin,Y-yes......
4238,Rustica,"This is awful... If you stepped in here without suspecting anything, your soul might've been destroyed."
4239,Chloe,Really......? I can't tell......
4240,Shylock,"Everything here is dancing in madness: a powerful and troublesome spell fell apart, and the order that existed in this room has been contaminated."
4241,Akira,You mean we can't go any further?
4242,Shylock,"What do you say, Murr?"
4243,Murr,I'll give it a go.
4244,Narrator,Murr responds and lifts his right hand with his sparkling ring.
4245,Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>
4246,Akira,......!
4247,Narrator,"Suddenly, a dreadful noise tears through the air. And I feel the unpleasant atmosphere in the room fade slightly."
4248,Murr,"I set up a temporary balance of reason here. But it'll go back to chaos in no time. If you're gonna head inside, hurry!"
4249,Akira,Got it.
4250,Shylock,How long will it hold?
4251,Murr,Probably long enough for me to do three loops in the sky!
4252,Shylock,"So about a hundred seconds. Chloe, stay here with Cock Robin. When there are ten seconds left, please start counting down."
4253,Chloe,Got it!
4254,Cock Robin,Please be careful!
4255,Narrator,"We step into the depths of the palace. The darkness fades as we advance, revealing the faint outlines of the room. Rustica lets out a quiet gasp."
4256,Rustica,......How terrible........
4257,Narrator,"A giant pile of human bones arranged in a circle emerges from the darkness. The bones are tied together with a green ivy of rose vines. It overwhelms us, like a giant, horrifying work of art. Within the center of the giant circle of human bones, there lies something resembling an altar."
4258,Shylock,".....They've tied together the sacrifices with a rose vine. This is a method you use when you merge living offerings, but...."
4259,Rustica,They couldn't prepare living sacrifices. That's why they used ancient bones instead...
4260,Narrator,Rustica lowers his eyes in sadness as he gazes at the giant pile of human bones.
4261,Rustica,Poor things.... The bones here weren't just lying around in the wild. They belong to sleeping souls who had been properly buried.
4262,Akira,"Sleeping souls who had been properly buried...... Are these the bones stolen from the cemetery....? If so, that means the grave-robbing culprit came here and......"
4263,Narrator,Murr gazes intently at the altar.
4264,Murr,There's no medium.
4265,Akira,Medium....?
4266,Rustica,"When you're making such a powerful circle, you need a medium. Such as a piece of a star or a holy tree, or a relic once owned by a hero...."
4267,Shylock,Which object within the Lunar Eclipse Palace was most worthy to be used as a medium....?
4268,Murr,The moonstone.
4269,Rustica,"The moonstone!? But if you use the moonstone as a medium, then god knows what could happen.... Most importantly, the moonstone will continue to hold the negative energy born from the failed ritual. We need to find it soon, or else we'll be in great trouble."
4270,Rustica,Who did this? And for what purpose...?
4271,Narrator,"At Rustica's question, I recall the other Murr's words from earlier."
4272,Akira,Murr's soul shard said that someone tried to beckon the moon to draw closer - that this was just one part of a greater magic circle....
4273,Shylock,Someone tried to beckon the < Great Catastrophe >...?
4274,Rustica,That's what caused this tragedy!? How terrible....
4275,Akira,"There's something else...... He also mentioned that the summoning failed, and that's why it transformed into an entirely different spell."
4276,Shylock,An entirely different spell...? What does that mean?
4277,Akira,He mentioned an Umbra... Umbra something. And that the twins would know about it.
4278,Chloe,Ten!
4279,Narrator,"We hear Chloe's voice, and look at each other with a start."
4280,Chloe,Nine! Eight!
4281,Rustica,"Let's get out of the room for now. Sir Sage, this way."
4282,Akira,Yes!
4283,Shylock,"Let's go, Murr.... Murr?"
4284,Murr,"Hey, what's that?"
4285,Narrator,"Murr runs towards the altar, peers beneath it, and starts pulling at something."
4286,Narrator,(Rustle)
4287,Murr,Huh? It's stuck.....
4288,Chloe,Five! Four! Three!
4289,Shylock,"Murr, hurry!"
4290,Murr,"Umm~, give me just one second......."
4291,Narrator,(Rustle)
4292,Chloe,Two! One!
4293,Murr,Got it!
4294,Narrator,(Flash of light) (Screen goes black)
4295,Shylock,<< Invibelle >>!
4296,Rustica,<< Amorest Viesse >>!
4297,Narrator,"Shylock and Rustica recite their spells just as Murr leaps away from the altar. For a brief second, the darkness enveloping Murr stops in its tracks. And Murr safely returns to our side. With something in his hand."
4298,Chloe,"God, you surprised me! I thought you wouldn't make it in time! Geez, don't make me so worried!"
4299,Murr,Look!
4300,Chloe,What's this......?
4301,Narrator,Murr shows us a half-melted scientific instrument of some sort.
4302,Shylock,This looks like the driving system for a piece of magical technology machinery. It materializes the magic from inside a mana stone. Though I'm not too familiar with this particular form.....
4303,Cock Robin,....This is.... This is what the Magical Technology Corps of our country uses......
4304,Chloe,Huh?
4305,Cock Robin,I'm sure of it.... Because the Ministry of Magical Affairs ordered these in an attempt to adopt the techniques of the West.
4306,Akira,....What does this mean?
4307,Shylock,It means someone from the Magical Technology Corps is involved... Or they were dragged into this mess as victims. We'll find out once we return to the castle.
4308,Akira,"Mister Cock Robin is safe, too, so that's probably the best thing to do for now. Let's head back to the castle."
4309,Rustica,"Yes. We need to ask Sir Snow and Sir White some questions, too."
4310,Chloe,"I need to give my friend the scarf I made, too!"
4311,Murr,Then let's head back together!
4312,Drummond,"I'm so glad you're safe, Cock Robin......! What in the world happened to you?"
4313,Akira,He was trapped inside the Lunar Eclipse Palace. But the wizards managed to rescue him!
4314,Drummond,"I see.... Good lord, don't be so reckless..... Um, ahem...... Sir Sage, I truly apologize for all the trouble my unworthy subordinate has caused....."
4315,Akira,"Not at all. Thanks to Mister Cock Robin, we managed to uncover a terrible secret."
4316,Drummond,What do you mean......?
4317,Cock Robin,There's some crazy people out there who tried to summon the < Great Catastrophe >!
4318,Drummond,W-what!?
4319,Cock Robin,"There were tons of bones, and a weird magic circle, and to top it off, equipment from our very own Magical Technology Corps!"
4320,Drummond,From the Magical Technology Corps!? What do you mean!?
4321,Shylock,"We too would like to uncover the truth. Who from the Magical Technology Corps was involved in this ritual - and how? For if that individual was the reason we lost ten of our comrades, and the reason that the whole world was consumed in chaos.... They are the common enemy of humans and wizards."
4322,Drummond,"Yes, you're right.... This is probably a situation where the Ministry of Magical Affairs and the Sage's wizards ought to work together......"
4323,Shylock,"I'm glad you seem to understand. So, where is that man who always seems to be so full of himself? The head of the Magical Technology Corps..."
4324,Drummond,Nicholas is.....
4325,Lady,Aaaaaaaah!
4326,Narrator,"At that moment, a scream breaks out. Chloe leaps to the window and points to the one of the castle's balconies, shouting."
4327,Chloe,"Look, over there!"
4328,Rustica,That's the captain of the Magical Technology Corps......!?
4329,Drummond,Sir Nicholas......!
4330,Akira,......!
4331,Narrator,"I look out the window, immediately stunned speechless. Mister Nicholas, the captain of the Magical Technology Corps, is leaning right over the castle balcony. He staggers unsteadily atop the balcony, with no trace of his strange wings or flying equipment."
4332,Drummond,"Sir Nicholas! What are you doing!? It's dangerous, Sir Nicholas!"
4333,Narrator,Nicholas gradually tilts forwards.
4334,Chloe,Watch out....!
4335,Narrator,"Chloe exclaims, as he leaps onto his broom and flies out the window."
4336,Nicholas,.....
4337,Narrator,"But before anyone can stop him, Nicholas throws himself off the balcony."
4338,Lady,Eeeeeeeeek!! Sir Nicholas!
4339,Chloe,Ah.....!
4340,Narrator,Mister Nicholas plummets to the ground before Chloe's hands can reach him. His body slams against the ground with great force. -Or so we think. But a clear voice rings out from the ground below.
4341,Arthur,<< Pernoctant Nixzo >>!
4342,Narrator,"Right before Mister Nicholas crashes to the ground, his body stops in midair, and gently floats to the ground. He loses consciousness and collapses, and Arthur, who stopped his fall with magic, rushes to his side."
4343,Arthur,"Nicholas! Nicholas, are you all right!?"
4344,Chloe,"Ah, I'm glad he's safe....! Thank you, Prince Arthur!"
4345,Arthur,"No, thank you! What in the world happened to Nicholas!?"
4346,Narrator,"At Arthur's words, I look up towards the balcony. I see someone standing on the same balcony that Mister Nicholas threw himself from moments earlier. I know that person."
4347,Owen,......
4348,Narrator,It's Owen. I can hear the commotion from the crowd on the ground.
4349,Man,What in the world happened!?
4350,Lady,Sir Nicholas leapt off the balcony......
4351,Man,Sir Nicholas would never do such a thing!
4352,Man,"......! Look at that! It's the Northern wizard, Owen!"
4353,Man,He tried to manipulate Sir Nicholas into committing suicide!
4354,Narrator,"Owen remains silent, staring down at the ground. His face is completely expressionless. Only when he notices the people pointing at him does he break into a faint, cold smile."
4355,Owen,............ Haha........ That's right. It's just as you desire. Every last misfortune that befalls you is my doing.
4356,Narrator,"Showered in a volley of angry roars and insults from the ground, Owen slowly turns away. And he disappears into the castle."
4357,Narrator,"A few hours later, the castle has descended into panic."
4358,Castle person,I hear that the Sage's wizards nearly killed Sir Nicholas......!
4359,Castle person,What!? Why would they do such a thing....?
4360,Castle person,It's the Northern wizards! They're all wicked wizards! They see humans as nothing but slaves!
4361,Castle person,I heard this from a friend: the wreckage caused by the < Great Catastrophe > was so devastating because the Northern wizards were so wicked!
4362,Castle person,Listen to what I heard from my friend's acquaintance - he said the Sage's wizards are all manipulating Prince Arthur!
4363,Castle person,But they're the ones who fought to protect the world.....
4364,Castle person,"You should never trust a wizard! You're young and beautiful, so they'll manipulate your heart and do whatever they please to you!"
4365,Castle person,How terrifying.....
4366,Castle person,They're scary.....
4367,Castle person,I'm scared...... I want them to leave the castle right now......
4368,Vincent,The Northern wizard tried to manipulate Nicholas into throwing himself off the balcony?
4369,Drummond,"Th-there's still no proof, but...... Lord Vincent, leaving that aside, there's another matter of great importance. Someone tried to summon the < Great Catastrophe >, and there's a possibility that they're connected to our Magical Technology Corps! The Ministry of Magical Affairs needs to work with the Sage's wizards to investigate the matter at once......"
4370,Vincent,Work with the men who nearly killed Nicholas? How preposterous! Drive the Sage's wizards out of the castle and send them back to the magic headquarters immediately.
4371,Drummond,But we've yet to perform the inauguration ceremony......
4372,Vincent,There's no need to hold an inauguration ceremony for traitors. I'll need to give Arthur a severe talking-to as well.
4373,Drummond,"Please wait, Lord Vincent! Finding out who tried to summon the < Great Catastrophe>, handling the mysterious incidents happening across the capital - we absolutely need the cooperation of the Sage's wizards to accomplish all these tasks!"
4374,Vincent,The Magical Technology Corps can handle it.
4375,Drummond,.....But.....
4376,Figaro,Owen killed the captain of the Magical Technology Corps?
4377,Akira,H-he didn't kill him. Mister Nicholas is still alive. But he hasn't regained consciousness yet......
4378,Figaro,So he's alive? But would Owen really fail if he wanted to kill someone like that?
4379,Snow,"Perhaps he never intended to kill him. Even if that were the case, Owen still enjoys tearing away at people's hearts, so...."
4380,White,"Perhaps Owen was simply having a fun time chatting, and Nicholas felt pressed into jumping off the balcony because of it."
4381,Narrator,"That can't be true... I try to say, but I can't finish my sentence. Because the memory of my conversation with Owen comes rushing back. I was engulfed with a mysterious sense of unease through a simple exchange of words."
4382,Cain,"Dammit, Owen, look what you've done.... Everyone's going to be even more suspicious of wizards now. The Western wizards told me about the remnants of the ritual in the Lunar Eclipse Palace. We need to figure out what's going on there as soon as possible, and yet......"
4383,Snow,What happened at the Lunar Eclipse Palace?
4384,Akira,Well......
4385,Cain,......Wait. Something's going on outside.
4386,White,Is that Mitile's voice......? He seems to be arguing with someone.
4387,Figaro,........ Let's check it out.
4388,Soldier,Your comrade tried to kill Sir Nicholas!
4389,Soldier,Just because the Magical Technology Corps threatened your status as heroes......! What unbelievable cruelty!
4390,Mitile,"We don't know anything about that! Owen is a Northern wizard, right!? The Southern wizards have nothing to do with....."
4391,Soldier,All wizards are the same! Get out of this castle! Stop taking advantage of Prince Arthur!
4392,Mitile,But we were invited here as guests!?
4393,Rutile,"Stop it, Mitile. The soldiers are just afraid."
4394,Mitile,But we didn't do anything wrong....!
4395,Rutile,Even so...... ....gh.
4396,Soldier,What are you muttering on about!? Get out of the castle right now!
4397,Mitile,Stop it! Don't hurt my brother......!
4398,Lennox,Let go of him.
4399,Soldier,Who are you!?
4400,Rutile,....Mister Leno.........
4401,Lennox,I'm a Southern wizard. But I can knock you out in three seconds without using any magic. And I can take your life in five seconds. What will you do?
4402,Soldier,.....Tch.... So the wizards hired a mercenary......
4403,Lennox,I'm a shepherd.
4404,Soldier,What the hell are you saying!? Let's go...... You need to grab your stuff and get out of here!
4405,Narrator,(Footsteps)
4406,Lennox,"......... But it's true....... Are you okay, Rutile?"
4407,Rutile,"Yes.... Thank you, Mister Leno. Your grand entrances have been really cool lately."
4408,Lennox,Really....?
4409,Mitile,He pulled nii-sama's hair! These Central soldiers are worse than the dine-and-dashers we see in the South!
4410,Rutile,"They think we almost killed their comrade, you know."
4411,Mitile,But that doesn't justify violence! You were the one who taught me that!
4412,Rutile,"You're right. You're a good boy, Mitile - thank you for getting angry in my stead. But you need to remember that people consumed by fear will do anything..... I didn't want you to get hurt; I also didn't want them to do anything terrible."
4413,Mitile,"You're too kind! They came to attack us because they think the Southern wizards are the weakest of them all! They just stand there, petrified and scared, in front of Oz and the Northern wizards, but when it comes to us, they're so stuck-up!"
4414,Rutile,......Mitile......
4415,Mitile,"......We're always the ones who lose out! It's all Owen's fault! He's a Northern wizard too, right!? The Northern wizards are the reason people hate all wizards....! I hate the Northern wizards....!"
4416,Figaro,"Rutile, Mitile! Leno, too - are you all right?"
4417,Mitile,"Dr. Figaro....! Waah.... It's the Northern wizards' fault that, nii-sama...."
4418,Figaro,What happened to Rutile?
4419,Rutile,I'm fine. A soldier just grabbed me for a second......
4420,Mitile,......Dr. Figaro! Why are we the ones who have to suffer when the Northern wizards are the ones who did everything wrong!? I hate the Northern wizards. And I hate the humans who can't say a word to the Northern wizards but take out their cruelty on us instead - I hate them even more!
4421,Figaro,Mitile......
4422,Mitile,"Dr. Figaro, I'm sorry.... You told me that I shouldn't think like a dictator, but I... I don't care if I am one...... If I had my own country, I would kick out all the bad guys.... I would protect nii-sama, and everyone else....."
4423,Lennox,"....I'm not necessarily agreeing with Mitile, but the castle is currently in chaos. It's dangerous for us to stay here."
4424,Rutile,....But the inauguration ceremony....
4425,Figaro,"If we stand on the balcony now, we're going to be showered in abuse, not applause. In times like these, humans are no different from bees. They'll sting away until the enemy has left their precious beehive. They don't know why they're mad, or who they're attacking. They don't think about what's going to happen as a result of their violence; they become blind and unstoppable."
4426,Rutile,........
4427,Figaro,"Rutile, are you sure you're not hurt?"
4428,Rutile,My body is fine.... But my heart is in pain. .....Conflict brings nothing but sadness.
4429,Rustica,"Oh, there you are, Chloe."
4430,Chloe,..........
4431,Rustica,"I know very well how whimsical Westerners can be, but the people of Central are certainly prone to mood swings as well. The person who said hello to me in the morning glared at me and ran away in the afternoon. I was a little bit surprised. Chloe?"
4432,Chloe,"Ah...... Rustica. Sorry, sorry. What was that?"
4433,Rustica,Did you hide something behind your back?
4434,Chloe,"No, not at all!"
4435,Rustica,"Ahaha. So now you're trying to surprise me too, Chloe. What are you hiding? A bird? A butterfly?"
4436,Chloe,Ah......!
4437,Rustica,"Come on, show me."
4438,Chloe,............
4439,Rustica,"....A torn scarf? Isn't this the scarf you embroidered, Chloe? This blue bird, right here. I remember you working on it, because I thought it was so lovely. How did it get torn?"
4440,Chloe,......Ah.... ....I gave it. To someone I made friends with at the party.
4441,Rustica,............
4442,Chloe,"She said it was pretty, so I told her she could have it as a symbol of our friendship. Then she was really, really happy! She said she'd show it off to her friends and family! ....But this morning.... She said she didn't want it, because a wizard's scarf was bound to have some horrendous curse on it.... She said, ""You're trying to deceive me and curse me to death, right?"" And she tore it and threw it to the ground...."
4443,Rustica,Chloe....
4444,Chloe,"It's fine, it's fine! I'm not feeling down about it or anything! I'm used to this sort of thing, anyway! .....But I'm an idiot, so I came up with all these ridiculous fantasies. Like, maybe if I give her this scarf, she'll put it on the next day, and come to say hi to me. Then I'd feel really ticklish inside, but I'd also be really happy, and say, it looks great on you...."
4445,Chloe,"Maybe her friends and family would ask me to make them scarves too, and I'd get really busy...... .......I came up with so many of those stupid fantasies, like the ones that play through your mind right before you fall asleep..... She was afraid it might be cursed.... Of course she was scared..... I'm such an idiot....."
4446,Rustica,You're not an idiot.
4447,Chloe,...I am an idiot.....
4448,Rustica,"Your dream is absolutely lovely. If she doesn't want the scarf, can I have it instead?"
4449,Chloe,"....It's nothing valuable. Rustica, you're handsome, so you deserve to wear something much nicer."
4450,Rustica,There's no scarf more valuable than this one.
4451,Chloe,....That's not true. I haven't used any expensive fabrics or threads....
4452,Rustica,Because this scarf is the only one of its kind in this world. It's something that only you could make.
4453,Chloe,..........
4454,Rustica,"It's more precious than a commonplace luxury you could find anywhere. It's more precious than the moonstone; more precious than any jewel. Here, look. This scarf was created by my beloved Chloe. It's the only one in the world. It has my favorite blue bird embroidered on it, too. It's a bit torn, but that's no cause for concern. For I have a friend who's very good at needlework."
4455,Rustica,"I'm sure he will fix it up perfectly. This blue bird will fly freely into the sky, no matter how many times its wings are torn. Isn't that right, Chloe?"
4456,Chloe,"......Yeah...... I'll sew it back together, as many times as I have to..... .....Thank you, Rustica."
4457,Rustica,"And you have my thanks as well. Don't cry...... Please smile, Chloe."
4458,Chloe,........ .....Yes......
4459,Rustica,"Please don't feel hurt. Like the bright moon that shines in the sky, we may be shoved away every time we approach someone, but...... We can smile wherever we are. We can sing the songs we love, and dance with the people we love, wherever we are."
4460,Vincent,"That damned Northern wizard Owen....... We never should have trusted the Northern wizards to begin with. It looks like Nicholas narrowly escaped death, but the Sage's wizards must leave the castle at once. Naturally, the inauguration ceremony is cancelled."
4461,Arthur,"Please wait, Uncle Vincent......"
4462,Vincent,Leave the festivities to me; you should consider staying at the royal villa for a while.
4463,Arthur,Huh......?
4464,Vincent,"There are awful rumors going around. They say that the reason Oz took you in was so he could take over Central Country. Prince Arthur is already under Oz's control, and will one day hand the kingdom over to him."
4465,Arthur,That's ridiculous...... Sir Oz isn't that kind of person!
4466,Vincent,"What proof do you have!? You are the ones who have stirred up the citizens' anxiety! Until the situation calms down, you should confine yourself to the royal villa, and......."
4467,Oz,..........
4468,Vincent,Oz...... Where did you come from......
4469,Arthur,Sir Oz......
4470,Oz,"If I so wished, I could conquer Central Country without controlling a child like him. Would you like me to show you my power?"
4471,Vincent,"...... You scoundrel! Guards, capture Oz......!"
4472,Arthur,Uncle!
4473,Central Country soldier,C-capture Oz......!? No one can do that........
4474,Vincent,The sun is going to set soon. Oz won't be able to use his magic!
4475,Oz,"Yet at this moment, I could turn this capital to ashes in an instant. I'll start with you."
4476,Arthur,"Sir Oz, please stop! Your anger is justified, but...."
4477,Oz,Out of my way.
4478,Arthur,......You're not serious.
4479,Oz,....... << Vox Nox >>
4480,Arthur,............ << Pernoctant Nixzo >>!
4481,Vincent,.......
4482,Soldier,"Th-thank goodness......! Prince Arthur protected him! Just as I thought, Prince Arthur is on our side! He's not being manipulated by Oz!"
4483,Oz,........
4484,Arthur,Sir Oz....
4485,Oz,You just narrowly escaped death.
4486,Arthur,".....Please wait, Sir Oz! Sir Oz-..... ......He disappeared......"
4487,Vincent,Never let Oz into the castle again!! He's a traitor who tried to kill me......!
4488,Arthur,You're wrong! Sir Oz isn't that kind of man! ......Sir Oz is...... He acted that way in order to create a place for me in this castle......
4489,Vincent,...... Hmph...... I don't believe that. That was his true nature. Guards! Find Owen - and Oz as well!
4490,Arthur,......Sir Oz...... Have you been avoiding me in order to protect my reputation......? But I have yet to repay you for any of your kindness......
4491,Oz,.......... ......I haven't seen his face up close in so long. ............ .....You've grown taller......
4492,Arthur,......Pardon me.
4493,Akira,Arthur...... Are you all right? I heard Mister Vincent summoned you......
4494,Arthur,"......He informed me that the Sage's wizards are to leave the castle and return to the magic headquarters...... The inauguration ceremony is cancelled...... The Magical Technology Corps will handle the investigation into the mysterious incidents at the cemetery...... And depending on what Nicholas says when he wakes up, Owen might be thrown into prison...... The same goes for Sir Oz as well......"
4495,Narrator,"Arthur, who is usually so full of life, lifts his head robotically. His clear eyes are saying, ""I am so, so sorry."" My heart lurches at his apologetic gaze - it hurts even more than his sadness and frustration."
4496,Arthur,......I apologize; this is all because of me - it's due to my incompetence and lack of power....... I failed to repay both you and Sir Oz; the current situation is entirely my fault......
4497,Akira,"Please don't make that face...... It's not your fault, Arthur......"
4498,Arthur,......But......
4499,Akira,"Let's hear what Owen has to say once we find him...... I'm sure that is part of my job as the Sage, so please - you don't have to shoulder all the responsibility for what has happened. I know that you treasure everyone here - that includes me, and the wizards, and the people in this castle. Your feelings truly came across......"
4500,Narrator,"With an unaffected and straightforward sincerity, Arthur smiles ever-so-slightly through his tears."
4501,Arthur,"......Thank you, Sir Sage. I am saved by your kindness...... I can't spend my time wallowing in regret. I'll apologize to everyone, hand over the investigation to the Magical Technology Corps, and prepare to leave the castle."
4502,Akira,Yes. But please don't push yourself.
4503,Arthur,"I'm all right. I feel better after speaking to you, Sir Sage. See you later!"
4504,Akira,I'm counting on you.
4505,Narrator,"I watch Arthur's back as he retreats into the castle, and let out a deep sigh. As I spin around, ready to get back to work, Owen appears right before my eyes without warning."
4506,Akira,......! Owen......!
4507,Owen,...........
4508,Narrator,"I observe Owen carefully, holding one hand to my chest, my heart pounding. Owen is not smiling. He appeared out of nowhere without saying a word, yet he's waiting for my reaction. I can't read his expression - but he seems lost, or perhaps dissatisfied. This is the first time I've seen him so close without an eerie grin on his face. His pale red eye, cold as glass, yet strangely alive...... His skin, white as a porcelain doll......"
4509,Akira,(......He's got a pretty face too......) (Do all wizards just have beautiful faces......?)
4510,Owen,Hey.
4511,Akira,"Ah, yes. Ah......! I have something I'd like to ask you regarding Mister Nicholas."
4512,Owen,"Yeah, that's what I thought, and I was waiting for you to say something, but you didn't utter a word. So I get to go first."
4513,Akira,Please wait! I was just a little distracted by something else......
4514,Owen,"You were distracted? When I'm right in front of your eyes? All right, tell me about it."
4515,Narrator,"I look at Owen, who is still wearing his thorny smile, and tell him honestly. Since I figure it's probably useless to lie to a wizard."
4516,Akira,"You're always grinning, so I never noticed till now, but..... You're very beautiful, Owen."
4517,Owen,................. Haha......
4518,Narrator,"Owen falls silent for a moment, and then tries to grin. But his attempt ends in failure, so he furrows his brows instead."
4519,Owen,So what?
4520,Akira,Sorry......
4521,Owen,"Well, whatever. There's something I'd like to ask you about the < Great Catastrophe >."
4522,Akira,"The < Great Catastrophe >? But wait, tell me about Mister Nicholas......"
4523,Owen,"Shut up. I'm first. You mentioned that bizarre injuries were inflicted upon us when we fought the < Great Catastrophe >, right? Like, Oz falls asleep when he tries to use magic, and Snow and White are trapped inside a frame in the middle of the night."
4524,Akira,Yes......
4525,Owen,Can you lose your memories from that?
4526,Akira,"Lose your memories? Wait, Owen...... Have you lost your memories?"
4527,Owen,.........
4528,Narrator,"His displeased expression sets off a chain of thoughts in my mind. When I saw him on the balcony this morning, he was in a daze. But in retrospect, that was a rather strange sight. Because when he tried to drive me into a corner, and whenever he hurled insults at the people around him - Owen always donned a mocking smile."
4529,Akira,.....You don't remember what happened when you were with Mister Nicholas?
4530,Narrator,Owen glares at me with frightening displeasure.
4531,Owen,You're wrong.
4532,Akira,B-but......
4533,Owen,I killed him. I manipulated his heart so that he would leap off the balcony.
4534,Akira,But why......
4535,Owen,"Why? Because I wanted to see him crushed like a tomato, of course."
4536,Narrator,"Owen puts on a cruel smile. He appears to be enjoying himself, but I get the feeling he's forcing himself to put on a show. I take a deep breath, and carefully try to persuade Owen."
4537,Akira,"Owen...... If you've lost your memories, then you can't be the only one responsible here. If you explain what happened, I'm sure everyone else will understand. Can you please tell me the truth?"
4538,Narrator,Owen smiles gently.
4539,Owen,I killed him. It was so much fun.
4540,Akira,......Owen......
4541,Owen,"Anyway, who cares about that? Tell me how to fix these bizarre injuries from the < Great Catastrophe >. Can you heal them? Or are you useless?"
4542,Narrator,"The word ""useless"" strikes a nerve within me, and I snap back without thinking."
4543,Akira,So you want me to heal your injury?
4544,Owen,.............
4545,Narrator,Owen looks ready to kill. I clamp my mouth shut. Terror wells up within me and I can no longer bear to look him in the eye.
4546,Owen,I'm asking you if you can heal this injury.
4547,Akira,"I-if.... If you didn't need me to fix it, you wouldn't be asking me for help."
4548,Narrator,"Owen's voice turns into a soft, coaxing purr, but his eyes alone remain unsmiling."
4549,Owen,"Hey, Sir Sage....... If I kill you, the world might end, but-. There are plenty of punishments far worse than death. Want me to teach you some?"
4550,Akira,......I'm aware of that. Because I've already subjected you to one such punishment.....
4551,Owen,......What?
4552,Akira,"I assumed that you might really have done it, so I blindly suspected you."
4553,Owen,..........
4554,Akira,I'm sorry.
4555,Narrator,"Owen is once again expressionless, just as he was when he stared down at the ground from the balcony. I now understand the emotion that lay behind this face. He was at a complete loss. He didn't know what to do until someone pointed a finger and yelled insults at him - the relief he felt then brought the grin back to his face."
4556,Owen,............ Haha........ That's right. It's just as you desire. Every last misfortune that befalls you is my doing.
4557,Owen,.....Ridiculous.
4558,Akira,Owen! Wait......!
4559,Narrator,Owen ignores me and vanishes like smoke.
4560,Narrator,"And thus, we leave the Central castle. As if we are being chased out: a stark contrast to our arrival."
4561,Snow,So in the end we couldn't find Owen......
4562,White,"They didn't even see us off. The situation in the Lunar Eclipse Palace is also bothering me, but first we need to regroup and figure out what to do next....."
4563,Shino,We're just going to head back like this? Seriously?
4564,Akira,Shino......
4565,Shino,What about the graverobbing incident at the cemetery? It has to be related to what was going on in the Lunar Eclipse Palace. And what happened to the inauguration ceremony? Let's negotiate with Arthur. I'm sure he can do something about it.
4566,Cain,Don't put Prince Arthur in an even more difficult position. He's suffering more than anyone else.
4567,Shino,How do you know who's suffering the most here?
4568,Cain,"Okay, maybe I was exaggerating a bit, but...."
4569,Shino,You can handle all this because you're a knight. But I'm a nobody. I was supposed to make a name for myself.
4570,Heathcliff,Shino......
4571,Cain,I am also a nobody. The days when I was the General of the Order of Knights are behind me now - they stripped me of my title when they discovered that I was a wizard.
4572,Riquet,Um......
4573,Mitile,"What is it, Riquet?"
4574,Riquet,I'm going back to the Church.
4575,Mitile,Huh!?
4576,Nero,What are you saying? What do you get out of heading back to a place where they won't even feed you decent meals?
4577,Riquet,"I'm worried about the people of the Church, and.... I don't see how the Sage's wizards are doing good if we caused the people at the castle so much trouble......"
4578,Mitile,That's the Northern wizards' fault!
4579,Mithra,Oh? Want to repeat that for me?
4580,Bradley,"What the hell, you shitty brat?"
4581,Mitile,"It's the truth! If you guys never did bad things, people wouldn't hate us wizards! People wouldn't think of us as a nuisance!"
4582,Mithra,"What are you saying? If people want to hate us, they should feel free to. And if you don't like them, just kick them out of your way. It's simple; you just have to be strong."
4583,Mitile,"See, that kind of thinking is what makes people hate wizards!"
4584,Mithra,What's wrong with that? Why do you want to be loved? Why do you fear being alone? It's not going to kill you.
4585,Mitile,Because I don't want to see the people precious to me get hurt!
4586,Mithra,..........
4587,Mitile,"I don't want to get hurt, either! If we'd been friendly, and if Owen had been a good person, then I'm sure the people at the castle would've listened to us. When the soldiers tried to hurt nii-sama - if I were strong enough, I would've wanted to beat them up. But if I'd done that, more people would've rushed over and it would've caused a bigger commotion. And ultimately it would've turned into a fight, which means someone would've gotten hurt."
4588,Rutile,Mitile......
4589,Mitile,What's wrong with being kind? What's wrong with getting along with everyone? It's not going to kill you.
4590,Mithra,It's unnecessary. You simply have to defeat every person who comes your way.
4591,Mitile,Listen......!
4592,Mithra,I am prepared to get hurt. I am prepared for the people around me to get hurt as well. In order for me to live freely - I accept the fact that I may be wounded all over.
4593,Mitile,.......
4594,Mithra,"""I don't want you to get hurt, so please change your way of life"" - I can't just agree to that."
4595,Mitile,......Even if it means someone precious to you will get hurt?
4596,Mithra,"I have no such person. And I don't plan to find one, either."
4597,Mitile,Then I feel sorry for you.
4598,Mithra,.........
4599,Mitile,"......Anyway, Riquet. Please don't say you're quitting. Let's do our best together!"
4600,Riquet,"......If, as Mitile says, it is truly possible to get along with everyone...... If being a Sage's wizard is a wonderful role that involves serving humans, just as the holy wizard Lord Faust did...."
4601,Faust,A wonderful role? Now that sounds like something I'd much rather refuse.
4602,Riquet,.........
4603,Figaro,"Where are you going, Faust?"
4604,Faust,I'm headed back to Eastern Country. I'll return to the tower when the < Great Catastrophe > strikes. Isn't that good enough? I'm tired of it. I'm tired of people having high hopes and celebrating me; I'm tired of people losing hope and chasing me away.
4605,Lennox,Sir Faust......
4606,Snow,Oz. Say something.
4607,White,You're the only one who can keep the Sage's wizards together.
4608,Oz,........ I certainly could force you to listen to my command. But I cannot bring your hearts and minds together. And there is no need for that.
4609,Cain,"But at this rate, we're going to fall apart. And that's fine; we can scatter. I also prefer to live freely. But this kind of goodbye just feels plain awful."
4610,Nero,"There's no way around it, Mister Knight. In the end, we just can't be with other people."
4611,Cain,Nero.....
4612,Nero,"Wizards have always been ostracized. That's just how it's always been, for many, many years. I know plenty of ways to live alone. I never learned how to do the opposite, though; I never had the chance. That's why I always reach my limit, no matter who I'm with - at some point, I can't stand it anymore. We've all gone through this sort of thing, right? Even if people say, ""poor you""; even if there are nights when you feel absolutely pathetic - sometimes, it's just plain impossible. I'm not cut out for living in the world - for being connected with others."
4613,Narrator,"A lonely silence envelops the wizards as we fly through the sky. Everyone here must have experienced true loneliness. Because they are different from people, they could never huddle close to them."
4614,Lennox,"......Rutile, are you all right?"
4615,Narrator,"Lennox worriedly calls out to Rutile, who has been looking downwards this entire time. Rutile gives him a tiny nod, and points to the city streets that sprawl outwards below our feet."
4616,Rutile,......I was just thinking that lots of people walk through the streets of Central......
4617,Bradley,Huh? What are you talking about? Southern wizards sure are a happy-go-lucky bunch.
4618,Narrator,Rutile makes a slightly troubled smile.
4619,Rutile,"There aren't this many people back in Southern Country. It's filled with mountains, forests, and barren landscapes...... When the sun sets, it goes completely dark. That's why - when you've been walking down a long road, and you finally run into someone - it makes you happy, even if they're just a stranger. It doesn't matter if they're a human or a wizard. You chat away, saying how lovely the weather is that day, and if they're in trouble, you help them out."
4620,Narrator,"Rutile's kind words are carried away by the sunset breeze. The wizards fly on through the evening sky. Everyone quietly listens without saying a word; some of them look disgruntled, but others wear more inscrutable expressions."
4621,Rutile,"The streets of Central are filled with people. They're all carrying loads of luggage along a narrow path; they continue to walk along, even though it looks like they're about to crash into each other. If everyone could walk at the same speed, it would be much easier. If everyone were headed in the same direction, arriving at their destination would be a simple task. But...... Their destinations, their walking speeds, the sizes of their bodies - everything about them is different, so they end up colliding, and getting in each other's way as they move forward. I think they're just like us right now."
4622,Nero,......
4623,Rutile,"We all think differently. We're all different people, headed in different directions. Each of us has our own destination. We've all walked different paths to get here, and we've encountered things that scare us, or things that we hate. Even if we shove each other out of the way, and glare at those walking by, the path won't grow any wider..... If we get used to others shoving us aside, huddle our shoulders, and keep our eyes down - the path still isn't going to get any wider. If we want to smile and walk along freely, we need to make the path wider...... If we allow the paths in our hearts to grow, then maybe we can all stay together."
4624,Narrator,"No one says anything; no one speaks up in denial or agreement. We continue to fly, spurred on by the wind, suspended between the lively streets below and the sunset-streaked sky. Some children run along the ground below as if they're chasing after us. They look up, and wave energetically at the sky. Murr laughs, and raises his palm. His ring glows, and flower petals fall from his fingertips. The children laugh merrily and reach out to the flower petals. Murr murmurs politely."
4625,Murr,You're welcome.
4626,Narrator,"Perhaps he heard them exclaim. Thank you, Mister Wizard!"
4627,Narrator,"After returning to the magical headquarters, I stand alone in my own room. The words of many people hazily drift through my mind. Rage and hope: at once lonely, earnest, and painful...... My eyes land on the sage's manual. I instinctively take it out, and flip through the pages. One page catches my eye:"
4628,Narrator,(Flips page)
4629,Akira,......On wizards......
4630,Narrator,"""On wizards."" ""I've been thinking a lot about the wizards. At first, I thought they were like Superman."" ""Or like troublesome supernatural beings, or local gods who make lots of requests."" ""They have miraculous magical powers, and they can easily do whatever they want. I thought they must be the real winners in life."" ""But that wasn't true."" ""They're the same as me."""
4631,Akira,............ ......The same......
4632,Narrator,"""The wizards here live their lives carrying the burden of defeating the < Great Catastrophe > that arrives once a year."" ""I lived the same kind of life back when I was a salaryman. I laughed like an idiot, but I was always anxious."" ""Is there a way out of this unchanging lifestyle?"" ""Is there any meaning in going out of my way when nobody expects anything of me?"" ""If I manage to be useful and people praise me for it, will that really make me happy?"" ""Will someone out there listen to what I want?"" ""How am I supposed to forge connections with people?"" ""Why does nobody say thank you to me? Is it because I'm a worthless person?"" ""If I were a wizard......"" ""Would anyone need me for anything other than my magic?"" ""......I still haven't found the answers to these questions. I don't think they've found them either."" ""That's why, at the very least......"" ""I want to be their friend."" ""I want to give them a place where they can be their true selves."" ""You need a place where you can laugh at your mistakes and let them go, or else you can't muster up the courage to take a step forward."" ""No one wants to shoulder a role where you're only going to be attacked over your responsibilities."" ""At least in this world, I want to be a friend who can say, ‘What are you doing (lol)' to them."" ""'Don't worry about it.' 'You did a great job.' 'Take a break. Let's work later.'"" ""I want to be a friend who can say that to them."""
4633,Akira,......Sir Sage......
4634,Akira,........
4635,Narrator,"Without realizing, I'm moved to tears while reading the sage's manual. I feel the same. I want to become friends with the wizards. I want to be someone they can smile freely around. We don't have to get along like family. Just like the stray cats who ran away when they first saw me, but, little by little, meowed and came closer to me. I want to build a small bridge of trust. Even if it's a thin, unreliable string, like a spider's web on a rainy day...... As long as there's something you can grasp with your own fingertips, you can carry on walking in this wide world, even if you're all alone."
4636,Faust,........
4637,Figaro,What are you doing out here so late at night?
4638,Faust,Figaro.....
4639,Figaro,Do you plan on leaving this place without a word?
4640,Faust,........... This has nothing to do with you.
4641,Figaro,Faust. The Granvelle monarchy has continued for generations after Alec's death.
4642,Faust,Your point is?
4643,Figaro,If your wounds haven't healed after being alone for all those years - that means you need someone else.
4644,Faust,........... .......I don't need anyone.
4645,Figaro,You're so stubborn. Though I guess you've always been this serious and stubborn. The Faust I knew was a pure and noble hero. There were people who kissed your shadow. Yet now you make a living out of cursing people?
4646,Faust,Shut up. Go away.
4647,Figaro,"Wait, hear me out. How does this sound? I'll steal your specialty."
4648,Faust,What are you trying to say?
4649,Figaro,"I'm going to curse you, Faust. You don't know what your bizarre injury is. The same goes for Heathcliff. You can't leave that child alone. Because if you leave this place, there will only be irresponsible wizards left. And the responsible ones have little magic power. Cain and Lennox - they don't stand a chance against me, or Oz, or Mithra and the others. You need to stay here. Or else Heathcliff, and the stubborn Shino, and Nero, who has trouble getting along with others - they'll all get beaten down."
4650,Faust,".....Even if I'm gone, there's still Snow and White......."
4651,Figaro,"Sir Snow and Sir White are like epitome of carelessness! They were my masters, as well as Oz's!"
4652,Faust,............
4653,Figaro,"But you don't have to worry about that. Forget about those poor young boys, and enjoy your good old solitary confinement. That is my curse; you know very well how words can also form curses. Take care."
4654,Faust,........You coward....!
4655,Figaro,One more word. I'm probably going to die soon.
4656,Faust,..............
4657,Figaro,"Maybe in fifty years.... maybe in five. It might even be next year. I guess it's true, what they say about wizards knowing when they're about to die. Tiretta realized that she was going to die, too."
4658,Faust,...... ......You're lying.....
4659,Figaro,"Unfortunately, I'm telling the truth. Please don't tell anyone else. You're the first person to hear this from me. Sir Snow and Sir White might have noticed. I'm not too sure about Oz; he can be a bit dense..... In any case, I'll turn to stone soon enough."
4660,Faust,......Why are you telling me?
4661,Figaro,"When I realized that I didn't have much time left - for the first time, I seriously thought about the world that you and Alec dreamed of. A world where humans and wizards can live together in harmony.... That's the world I want to leave behind for the children. And in order to accomplish that, I need your power."
4662,Faust,......... .....You're lying. I refuse to believe you. You're just trying to fool me with a nasty lie.
4663,Figaro,"That might be true. So this is something like a curse, too."
4664,Faust,..........
4665,Figaro,"Good night, Faust."
4666,Riquet,.........
4667,Nero,You're still awake? It's way past bedtime for kids.
4668,Riquet,Nero......
4669,Nero,Did you get a little hungry?
4670,Riquet,Why did you stop me from leaving? You were the one who said that wizards could never be with other people......
4671,Nero,There was no deep reason for it. I just thought you shouldn't have to go back to a place where they wouldn't even feed you a decent meal.
4672,Riquet,......
4673,Nero,Didn't my cooking taste good?
4674,Riquet,Yes......
4675,Nero,Tomorrow's breakfast is gonna be bread pudding.
4676,Riquet,Bread pudding......?
4677,Nero,"Haha...... It's crispy, soft, and sweet."
4678,Riquet,That sounds delicious......
4679,Nero,"Doesn't it? Now you have something to look forward to as you head off to bed. That's what kids should do. Just think about what you're gonna eat tomorrow, and drift away into the land of sweet dreams. Good night, Riquet."
4680,Riquet,"Good night, Nero. ......Also, let me say one thing."
4681,Nero,What is it?
4682,Riquet,"You said you weren't cut out to live with others, but...... I like the time that I spend with you, Nero."
4683,Nero,......
4684,Riquet,"The food that you make - while you act like it's a pain, but also like it's no big deal - in my eyes, those meals are a miracle as wondrous as a dream. And the words you offered me today, when you told me to stay. Those words were for me, not for a disciple of God. You didn't say, ""Eat this""; instead, you asked me, ""Which one do you like?"" That was how I discovered what I loved for the first time in my life. I came to realize what kind of person I was...... And that's terrifying, but it's also exciting - and I look forward to seeing what comes next."
4685,Nero,Riquet......
4686,Riquet,"I'm sure I'll wake up early tomorrow. I can't wait to open my eyes in the morning. Thank you, Nero. Thank you for giving me a reason to look forward to tomorrow."
4687,Vincent,Did you find the culprits who ransacked the cemetery?
4688,Soldier,"We're still investigating...... Everyone is spooked, you see......"
4689,Vincent,"How absurd. It's probably just robbers who used the attack of the < Great Catastrophe > as a cover to steal burial goods from the graves. Even if there was magic at work, we can handle anything so long as we have the Magical Technology Corps on our side. How is Nicholas doing?"
4690,Soldier,It seems like he just regained consciousness......
4691,Nicholas,............
4692,Vincent,Nicholas.
4693,Soldier,Sir Nicholas......
4694,Vincent,"I hear that the Northern wizard Owen manipulated your heart. As the leader of the Magical Technology Corps, you are not setting a proper example for your subordinates."
4695,Nicholas,"............ Forgive me, Lord Vincent. I shall offer my life in apology."
4696,Vincent,What?
4697,Soldier,The darkness is swarming around him......!
4698,Vincent,Wh......
4699,Soldier,Lord Vincent! There's the shadow of a bird looming behind Sir Nicholas......!
4700,Nicholas,............
4701,Soldier,The shadow......! The bird's shadow is swallowing up Sir Nicholas!
4702,Nicholas,......I...... ......Wanted to......
4703,Narrator,(Squawk)
4704,Vincent,What......?
4705,Soldier,"It completely swallowed him......! Lord Vincent, please escape!"
4706,Vincent,......!
4707,Narrator,(Squawk)
4708,Soldier,I-it seems to have flown away! We have to notify Sir Drummond and the Sage's wizards immediately......!
4709,Vincent,Wait! It might be some kind of magical technology that Nicholas obtained!
4710,Soldier,No way......! Sir Nicholas was just swallowed by the bird's shadow......
4711,Vincent,Silence! Do not utter a word of this to anyone. Understand?
4712,Soldier,Y-yes......
4713,Vincent,"......If the Sage's wizards continue to strengthen their reputation through achievements, Arthur is going to win more popularity with the people. If Arthur had never returned to the castle, I would have been the next king. What do wizards know of the human world? I am the one who is suited for the role, not Arthur......"
4714,Skinny Central child,Uu...... Uuu......
4715,Mithra,......
4716,Skinny Central Country child,Uu...... My stomach hurts...... Uu...... Ehehe...... But if I make it through...... Then this thing will be mine......
4717,Mithra,You're right.
4718,Skinny Central Country child,Ehehe...... Uuu...... Fufu......
4719,Mithra,"The Umbra Volans is swooping through the land. It should begin soon. I do hope you entertain me, Sir Sage."
4720,Narrator,A few days later-
4721,Cain,Prince Arthur hasn't sent word from the Central capital yet. I wonder how he's doing...... Should I go check on him in secret?
4722,Shylock,I would recommend against it. We have essentially been ordered to quarantine ourselves here.
4723,Cain,But we need to find the culprit behind the incident at the Lunar Eclipse Palace....
4724,Shylock,"Of course. That is why, until things calm down, we need to do all the investigating we can here at the magic headquarters."
4725,Cain,Investigating? At the magic headquarters......? Wh-what's with this mountain of massive books!?
4726,Shylock,Please research the Umbra Volans.
4727,Cain,"......... You see, I'm not very good at deskwork....."
4728,Shylock,I know very well. You mischievous boy.
4729,Snow,"Umbra Volans, Umbra Volans......"
4730,White,What was it again......
4731,Chloe,"Please try your best to remember! Murr apparently said that you two would know about it! Right, Murr!"
4732,Murr,Looks like it!
4733,Snow,Hmm...... I feel like I might remember if I ate something sweet......
4734,White,Maybe if someone massaged my shoulders......
4735,Chloe,"You said that yesterday, too. Geez, you keep repeating yourselves~."
4736,Murr,It's because they're old geezers!
4737,Snow,We're not old geezers!
4738,White,We're not old geezers~!
4739,Figaro,"And we still don't know anything about the piece of equipment that belonged to the Magical Technology Corps, right?"
4740,Shylock,"Even if they'd found anything, they might not report it to us. For it could very well cause a scandal for Central Country."
4741,Figaro,"I'd welcome a scandal or two - otherwise, they're going to start hunting wizards."
4742,Akira,You mentioned that before. What does that mean?
4743,Figaro,"Magical technology is fueled by mana stones. Mana stones are the stones of wizards - they contain their magic powers. Mana stones are being burned more quickly than ever now due to the emergence of magical technology equipment. Eventually, we'll run into a shortage of mana stones. And when there's a shortage, what will humans do? I think the Western wizards know the answer to this question. Shylock. I hear that in Western Country, they hunted magical creatures to the brink of extinction."
4744,Shylock,"It's just as you say. With the advancement of science, the West has entered an era of madness. Western Country has always been lacking in morals. But now that the citizens' desires have grown exponentially - they've become unstoppable."
4745,Figaro,"Back in the day, we thought it was impossible for humans to kill magical beasts. But now there are too many humans. And with the development of magical science weaponry...... If a weak child like Mitile were attacked, he'd get turned into stone. I want to prevent that kind of future from coming to pass."
4746,Cain,We need to start by getting people to trust wizards. Where in the world is the root of all evil - Owen?
4747,Snow,I wonder.
4748,White,"We're not close enough to pay him a home visit, you see."
4749,Cain,"This is about the Northern wizards, so please, pull yourselves together. What are Owen's special characteristics?"
4750,Snow,"He can speak to beasts, such as wolves. He was a huntsman, after all. He's also skilled at absorbing magic."
4751,White,"Wizards usually obtain their magic from nature, but Owen is a bit special."
4752,Snow,He gains his power from human emotions. That's why we think he can't be too far from where humans live......
4753,Narrator,(Door opens)
4754,Heathcliff,......Sir Sage.
4755,Akira,Ah...... What is it?
4756,Heathcliff,"I apologize for interrupting, but Shino came across a visitor just now......"
4757,Shino,We have guests. Can I bring them in?
4758,Akira,Guests......?
4759,Narrator,"The person that the two Eastern youths bring over is - Central Country's secretary, Mister Cock Robin. Alongside a beautiful lady with an air of competence around her."
4760,Cock Robin,"It's been a while, Sir Sage. Um, this is......"
4761,???,"I'm Canary, Cock Robin's wife. Thank you for taking care of my husband. Could you let me work here too?"
4762,Akira,Work here at the magic headquarters......?
4763,Canary,"Yes! I just couldn't sit still after hearing what he told me! The world was saved thanks to Sir Sage and his wizards, yet you don't even have anyone to take care of you! If you don't mind, I'd love to help out - I can do cleaning, laundry, you name it!"
4764,Akira,Th...... Thank you!
4765,Canary,"That's not all. Come on, say it."
4766,Cock Robin,"Hey, give me a moment...... I need to prepare......"
4767,Canary,Stop mumbling. Muster up some courage!
4768,Cock Robin,......
4769,Narrator,"Miss Canary pushes him forward, and Mister Cock Robin approaches me. He nervously opens his mouth, book and pen in hand."
4770,Cock Robin,I...... I'm a scribe...... Making a record of events is my job.
4771,Akira,Yes......
4772,Cock Robin,"I was wondering if you would let me write about everyone here until the next < Great Catastrophe > arrives? And, if possible, I'd like to report my writings to the castle."
4773,Akira,Why would you...... Is it because you don't trust us......?
4774,Cock Robin,"No, it's the other way round. I want them to understand - what wizards are like, and how they saved the world, and so on. What kind of situation you're in, what you're thinking, what's bothering you...... Neither the people in the castle nor the townspeople know anything about you. I was the same. That's why I was scared...... But the wizards still saved me. I want to keep a proper record, so I can convey that wizards are not who people think they are; that they're working this hard for our sake. I'm sure I met the previous sage a number of times, but for some reason I can't remember his face or his name...... But if we kept a proper record, then I'm sure we'd all be able to remember. We would know that the Sage was here, and we would remember the things that he did."
4775,Akira,Mister Cock Robin......
4776,Cock Robin,"This was actually Sir Drummond's suggestion. But he said to keep it a secret, so please don't tell him...... He said that wizards were the ones who helped us when the world was in trouble - when I was in trouble. He didn't want you to think that humans are all ungrateful."
4777,Narrator,"I recall Mister Drummond's face, and my chest grows warm. There are still humans who care about wizards like this. That alone makes me happy."
4778,Akira,Thank you...... I'm sure everyone else will be delighted too.
4779,Cock Robin,Yes!
4780,Canary,"Sir Sage, mister wizards. I'm sure there will be lots of trouble lying ahead of you all, but please never give up. I'll cheer you on with everything I've got!"
4781,Narrator,"With Mister Cock Robin and Miss Canary's arrival at the magic headquarters, the wizards begin to regain their spirits."
4782,Cock Robin,"Time to record everything I can! So when wizards use too much magic, their hearts become exhausted, and they grow fatigued......"
4783,Murr,Boo!
4784,Cock Robin,......You surprised me! Why did you do that?
4785,Murr,Because I like surprising people.
4786,Cock Robin,.....
4787,Narrator,(Writing sounds)
4788,Cock Robin,The Western wizard Murr enjoys surprising people......
4789,Murr,You're writing it down! What a diligent guy!
4790,Canary,Delicious! I didn't realize the extra step would make it taste so much better.
4791,Nero,"Glad I could help. Okay, I need to go now......"
4792,Canary,"Mister Nero, could you teach me more about cooking from now on? If you don't mind, that is."
4793,Nero,............
4794,Canary,"I'm not that good at cooking, I'd be very grateful for your help."
4795,Nero,I guess...... Once in a while......
4796,Canary,Great! Thank you very much!
4797,Nero,Haha...... You're welcome.
4798,Shino,We still don't know what Heath's bizarre injury is?
4799,Heathcliff,Don't bring it up...... I'm getting more and more anxious.
4800,Cain,Hopefully it's not one of the painful types. Shylock looks like he has it rough. Though it's pretty inconvenient not being able to see people until I touch them.
4801,Shino,What kind of injury could you handle?
4802,Heathcliff,Umm...... Sneezing yourself into the distance seems kind of fun.
4803,Bradley,You bastard.
4804,Heathcliff,.......I-I didn't realize you were around.
4805,Bradley,"""Seems kinda fun?"" This isn't a damn joke."
4806,Shino,"Oh, so you get blasted away seriously?"
4807,Bradley,The hell!?
4808,Cain,"Don't threaten them, Bradley."
4809,Bradley,"First things first, you bastards need to...... Ah-choo!!"
4810,Narrator,(Poof)
4811,Shino,.......... He's gone.
4812,Heathcliff,"Yeah, that does seem fun."
4813,Narrator,(Footsteps)
4814,Riquet,I'm sorry! Mitile and I were blowing dandelion puffs!
4815,Mitile,Did they come this way?
4816,Cain,No worries. You guys did a great job.
4817,Narrator,That night-.... I witness a new bizarre injury.
4818,Akira,......I woke up in the middle of the night...... Guess I'll have a cup of tea before I go back to bed...... ......Huh......? What is this......?
4819,Narrator,A quiet illusion floats along the moonlit corridor. It's a cluster of lilac-colored flower petals. But they disappear in an instant.
4820,Akira,......Ah...... It turned into snow......
4821,Narrator,"In an instant, the dancing flower petals turn into fine snow. But the snow disappears before it has a chance to pile up, like churning sea foam dissolving between the waves. I chase after the wondrous illusion that comes drifting my way from above the stairs."
4822,Akira,......It's coming from the door to that room...... That's...... Faust's room......
4823,Lennox,Sir Sage.
4824,Akira,Lennox......
4825,Lennox,What are you doing up so late? ......Where is this snow coming from......?
4826,Akira,It seems to be spilling out from the cracks in Faust's door.
4827,Lennox,Sir Faust's......
4828,Narrator,Lennox falls silent. The dancing snowflakes gradually turn into glowing red sparks. The sparks don't catch fire; they simply vanish in silence. But I still grow concerned.
4829,Akira,"......Is this some kind of spell? Lennox, do you know what this is?"
4830,Lennox,No......
4831,Narrator,(Knock knock)
4832,Narrator,"After hesitating for a moment, I knock on Faust's door."
4833,Akira,Faust...... Faust.
4834,Narrator,"There's no response. Under the dark moonlit night, the red glow of the sparks burns even brighter."
4835,Lennox,"He might have set up a barrier. Sir Faust is a very cautious person, after all."
4836,Figaro,What are you two up to?
4837,Akira,Figaro......
4838,Narrator,"Figaro calls out to us from below the stairs. Before we can reply, Figaro notices the strange affair and furrows his brows. The fire burns with greater intensity, the flames curling out from behind the doorframe."
4839,Figaro,Stand back. I'll open the door.
4840,Narrator,Figaro places his hand on the doorknob and solemnly chants his spell.
4841,Figaro,<< Possideo >>
4842,Narrator,The doorknob turns as the sound of his magic slices through the air.
4843,Narrator,(Door opens)
4844,Akira,......Ah......
4845,Narrator,"I fall silent at the scene that greets us beyond the door. A blazing, furious fire surrounds the bed where Faust sleeps. And every corner of the room overflows with strange illusions that crowd around him. The window reflects the hill of execution. On the ceiling: a boy who looks just like Arthur. Figaro and Lennox are there, too And Faust, who is surrounded by people who love and respect him, wearing a calm and gentle smile on his face. Yet I can also see a scene of Faust being crucified and burned at the stake."
4846,Lennox,......These must be...... Sir Faust's dreams......
4847,Akira,Faust's dreams......
4848,Faust,......Nn......
4849,Narrator,"Faust stirs slightly. We hold our breath, and Figaro speaks."
4850,Figaro,Let's get out of here before he wakes up.
4851,Narrator,We leave Faust's room and walk through the courtyard. The sight we just witnessed is seared into my mind.
4852,Lennox,......Was that the bizarre injury that the < Great Catastrophe > left on Sir Faust?
4853,Figaro,Probably. It looks like the exact thing he would hate more than anything else in the world.
4854,Akira,Were those illusions in Faust's room images from his past......?
4855,Figaro,"It wasn't just his past; his desires probably manifested a part of those images, too. I didn't participate in the final battle."
4856,Akira,Why......?
4857,Figaro,"I abandoned the front lines. Faust still resents me for it. But I didn't leave because I was struck by panic. Victory was right before our eyes. We all believed the human Alec and the wizard Faust would establish a new, ideal country. I never thought that Alec would be swayed by his close aides and end up actually executing the wizards."
4858,Akira,......Execute......
4859,Lennox,Of course it was possible to resist execution. But Sir Faust believed that Sir Alec would never carry it out........ Until the very moment the fire was lit......
4860,Akira,..........
4861,Lennox,"I will never forget that day...... But I never realized that he still dreamed of it so vividly, even now...... I don't think I could possibly ever imagine.... The sheer depth of his pain."
4862,Figaro,"If he discovers the truth about his bizarre injury, Faust will probably say that he's leaving the magic headquarters. We all have our pasts that we would rather hide from others. If his overflows while he's unconscious...... He could probably prevent his dreams from overflowing by establishing an even more powerful barrier, but there's no reason for him to go through that effort just to stay here. If we stay silent, then everything will remain within the realm of dreams. He might not realize what's going on...... I'll leave the decision to you, Sir Sage."
4863,Akira,"........... Lennox, are you all right with that?"
4864,Lennox,......I would like you to tell him what's going on. Even if it ultimately leads to Sir Faust leaving the magic headquarters...... I don't want to rob him of anything else that he might trust.
4865,Akira,............
4866,Narrator,"After thinking about it for a night, I decide to tell Faust."
4867,Faust,............
4868,Narrator,"Faust looks shocked, but he listens till the end without saying a word. He doesn't get mad, or try to run away; he simply stands there in silence, as if he's enduring everything I'm telling him."
4869,Akira,"......If you choose to stay here, I will do anything I can to support you, Faust. I will figure out how to keep you from getting hurt. I can't force you to stay, but please consider it."
4870,Faust,"............ Why did you tell me? If you had stayed silent, I might never have realized what was going on."
4871,Akira,"I really would like you to stay here at the magic headquarters, Faust. But...... Nobody wants other people to find out about their deepest secrets. Hiding this from you while relying on you for your knowledge and magic - I didn't want to take advantage of you like that. I wanted you to believe in me...... I wanted you to stay here because you trusted me."
4872,Faust,............ ......I see. I'll remain.
4873,Akira,Faust......
4874,Narrator,"He lowers his eyes, falling silent."
4875,Faust,......But I want to set up a powerful barrier to prevent my dreams from overflowing. I'll head out to the East in order to obtain the appropriate medium. I will be gone for a while. Is that all right?
4876,Akira,"Of course...... Thank you, Faust."
4877,Faust,Not at all.......
4878,Lennox,Sir Faust. Please take me with you.
4879,Akira,Lennox......
4880,Lennox,"I'm sure I can at least serve as a watchguard. Please, let me join you."
4881,Narrator,"Faust looks ambivalent. But he doesn't glare at Lennox in displeasure; instead, he sighs softly."
4882,Faust,There's nothing I can do for you anymore.
4883,Lennox,I never wished for you to do anything for me. I simply want to be of use to you.
4884,Faust,.......Have you been searching for me all these years?
4885,Lennox,"I wandered through many lands. Though I've been in the South ever since I met Sir Figaro, the one who taught you magic."
4886,Faust,I see...... I'm sorry.
4887,Narrator,Lennox smiles gently.
4888,Lennox,"Why are you apologizing? I was able to meet you again. And this time, I will follow you to the ends of the earth."
4889,Faust,I'm just looking for a medium. I won't abandon my students and run away - I'm not Figaro.
4890,Lennox,Sir Figaro was worried about you too.
4891,Faust,I wonder about that.
4892,Narrator,"Watching their exchange brings a smile to my face. Faust, who kept insisting that Lennox had the wrong person, is now accepting him. His dreams, which weighed him down from every corner of his room, must have been alleviated ever-so-slightly. As he heads out of the room, Faust turns around to look at me."
4893,Faust,Sage.
4894,Akira,Yes......
4895,Faust,"I, too, once wanted the trust of a certain human. But I simply made a fool of myself. The same thing might happen to you. I might just never return from this journey."
4896,Narrator,Faust says cynically. But his gaze isn't bitter; instead it looks almost longing. I look him in the eye.
4897,Akira,"Even so I....... I want to believe that you will return, so I will wait for you here."
4898,Faust,............
4899,Akira,"Have a safe journey, Faust."
4900,Faust,Hmph......
4901,Narrator,"Faust walks out of the hallway. I don't know what he was trying to say, and I don't know what he wanted to hear from me.... I don't know if my feelings came across to him. But I think of Faust's calm smile from yesterday, and something tells me that this won't be a lonely last farewell. Lennox bows to me slightly before chasing after Faust. And thus, the two of them leave the magical headquarters."
4902,Narrator,"The next day, Rutile and the others ask if they can go to the Central capital."
4903,Rutile,"We were in the middle of repair work, and I'm still worried about how everyone in Central is doing......"
4904,Akira,But what if they chase you away like last time......?
4905,Figaro,It's been a while; we should be all right. People aren't really afraid of Southern wizards anyway.
4906,Mitile,I want to go help alongside nii-sama too! Plus...
4907,Riquet,"I want to go, too."
4908,Akira,Riquet......
4909,Riquet,"Mitile invited me, so...... I want to see if I can use my powers to help people."
4910,Riquet,I'll think about whether I want to return to the Church after that.
4911,Akira,"I understand. Everyone, please be careful. I would be less worried if Lennox were around, but......"
4912,Rutile,"Mister Leno was able to make up with Mister Faust, right? Mister Leno seemed so happy."
4913,Figaro,"It's not like they had a falling out, actually. Faust was just avoiding him. Leno used to be Faust's servant."
4914,Mitile,"Mister Faust seemed kind of scary, but if he's an old friend of Mister Leno, then he must be a good person."
4915,Figaro,"That's right. Well then, Sir Sage, we'll get going......"
4916,Bradley,I'll come with you.
4917,Akira,Bradley......
4918,Bradley,"You're going to go help out with repair work, right? I'm joining you to get my pardon. That's fine by you, right, Sage?"
4919,Akira,Y-yes. Of course.
4920,Mitile,But you wanted to ditch so badly......
4921,Rutile,"See, everyone here is a kind person at their core. Let's get along, Mister Bradley."
4922,Bradley,Yeah. Give me a sec. I'm gonna get ready.
4923,Narrator,(Water boiling)
4924,Nero,Hmhm~. Let the meat sauce cook overnight~......
4925,Bradley,"Hey, come here for a sec."
4926,Nero,Woah!? What the hell are you doing!?
4927,Bradley,Cut the humming. The bloody chef Nero sure lost his edge.
4928,Nero,Shut up......
4929,Bradley,Can I get a bite?
4930,Nero,"Not yet, you idiot! What the hell do you want? If you're just here to pick a stupid fight, I'll make it rain pepper."
4931,Bradley,"Hold off, you idiot! Hey, tag along with me tonight. We're gonna sneak off to the Lunar Eclipse Palace in Central."
4932,Nero,The Lunar Eclipse Palace?
4933,Bradley,Yeah. All the treasures they took from me when I got captured are stashed away there. I'm gonna use this opportunity to get them back. I eavesdropped on the guys from the West. They say the Lunar Eclipse Palace is a mess right now. It's the perfect opportunity to take everything back.
4934,Nero,Stop messing with me! I said I went clean!
4935,Bradley,It's not stealing. I'm just taking it back.
4936,Nero,"Yeah, and you stole it in the first place......"
4937,Bradley,"What was that, Nero? Are you gonna put up a fight? Do you think you stand a chance?"
4938,Nero,"......I thought getting thrown into jail might've helped you fix that attitude, but you really haven't changed at all......"
4939,Bradley,Shut up. You should just listen to my orders.
4940,Nero,...............
4941,Bradley,"Come on, buddy! Fine, I'll make this the last time. We'll go our separate ways after this, Nero. We never finished our last job because I got captured. So let's wreak havoc in the Lunar Eclipse Palace and call that the end."
4942,Nero,............ So this is really gonna be the last time?
4943,Bradley,That's how I feel right now. But I tend to change my mind easily.
4944,Nero,Sigh...... Fine.
4945,Bradley,Alright. Can I eat this meat sauce?
4946,Nero,"Don't touch it, fucker! It still needs to simmer. Want me to turn you into meat sauce?"
4947,Bradley,"You're so scary, geez......"
4948,Mithra,Sigh............
4949,Rutile,Mister Mithra.
4950,Mithra,......What is it?
4951,Rutile,Were you taking an afternoon nap?
4952,Mithra,No...... I've had trouble sleeping lately......
4953,Rutile,I see...... Shall I bring you some herbs that will help with your sleep? You can put them inside your pillow.
4954,Mithra,What do you want from me?
4955,Rutile,"Ah...... I'm sorry. I'm headed off to the Central capital right now. If you'd like, I can collect what you lent to that child."
4956,Mithra,What I lent to who......? What are you talking about?
4957,Rutile,"A skinny, intelligent child in the Central capital. He said he was carrying something that belonged to you, Mister Mithra."
4958,Mithra,Huh...... I don't know what you're talking about.
4959,Rutile,I see......
4960,Mithra,You always talk about things that make no sense.
4961,Rutile,"............ I remember them, so they aren't just things that make no sense. To me, they're precious memories."
4962,Mithra,Okay......
4963,Rutile,......Sorry for bothering you. I hope you get lots of rest. Excuse me.
4964,Narrator,(Footsteps)
4965,Mithra,"............ ......Herbs, huh. She loved them too. She always mixed those strange-smelling things into her magical potions....... I still can't believe that you no longer exist in this world. The great witch, Tiretta."
4966,Rutile,"Well then, see you later!"
4967,Cock Robin,Mister Rutile! Would you let me ride on your broom? I'd like to make a report to Sir Drummond.
4968,Rutile,"Of course, I'd be glad to!"
4969,Cock Robin,Thank you!
4970,Canary,"Have a safe trip! Take care, dear!"
4971,Figaro,"You're a lucky guy, Cock Robin."
4972,Mitile,"Riquet, let's compete!"
4973,Riquet,Yes! Of course!
4974,Akira,"See you later. Take care, everyone. ......Hmm......? I feel like I just saw someone pass by...... Maybe it was just my imagination......"
4975,Cain,"Looks like the Southern wizards have headed off to Central. I wanted to join them, but the higher-ups have been keeping a close watch on me lately."
4976,Heathcliff,On you? Why?
4977,Cain,"See, they've started these baseless rumors. Something about me colluding with a powerful noble from another country, and selling information about the Central troops."
4978,Shino,A powerful noble from another country?
4979,Cain,Yeah. I don't know anyone like that.
4980,Shino,Isn't it this guy?
4981,Heathcliff,I...... I think it might be me......
4982,Cain,"Oh, right! I forgot you were something like a nobleman's son!"
4983,Shino,"""Something like a nobleman's son""? Know your place. You're just a former knight; Heath is of higher status than you."
4984,Heathcliff,"Yeah, speak for yourself first, Shino."
4985,Shino,"What? You were the one who got all embarrassed when I called you ""my lord."" I wanted to call you that."
4986,Cain,"I get you, I get you! It makes you feel like a loyal vassal. I've addressed Prince Arthur like that before."
4987,Heathcliff,And what did Prince Arthur say......?
4988,Cain,"He was surprised, and then he laughed."
4989,Shino,The dude's pretty cheerful.
4990,Cain,"Hey, don't call him a dude. He's my master."
4991,Heathcliff,You two are peas in a pod. I'll go make some tea.
4992,Cain,Yeah.
4993,Shino,Please.
4994,Heathcliff,"......See, you say all that, but then you make me brew your tea. If we were at home, a servant would be yelling at you right now."
4995,Cain,What was that?
4996,Heathcliff,"Haha, it's nothi-......!"
4997,Shino,What is it?
4998,Heathcliff,Did you see someone outside the window just now?
4999,Cain,"I mean, I can't see anyone, so... ..........! I can see him........"
5000,Heathcliff,"Where are you headed with your sword, Cain!?"
5001,Cain,There's only one guy I can see!
5002,Heathcliff,Who?
5003,Cain,Owen.
5004,Narrator,(Door opens)
5005,Cain,............!
5006,Akira,"Ah...... Sorry, I forgot to knock. Did I surprise you?"
5007,Cain,"This voice... Is that you, Sir Sage?"
5008,Akira,Yes. Let's shake hands...... Can you see me now?
5009,Cain,Yeah. Be careful. Owen's here in the magic headquarters. I'll go check the courtyard.
5010,Akira,I'll go with you!
5011,Cain,"Where are you...... Owen! Owen, show yourself!"
5012,Narrator,"The courtyard greenery rustles noisily. Clouds drift across the clear blue sky, blocking out the sun. Suddenly, Cain stops walking. He gazes intently at the shadow of a tall tree, muttering under his breath."
5013,Cain,......There he is.
5014,Narrator,He's right; there's someone hiding in the shadows cast by the tree. Someone who is gazing in our direction.
5015,Cain,I'll go check. You stay here.
5016,Akira,"Yes...... Um, please listen to what Owen has to say. He has no memory of what happened at the time."
5017,Cain,"If I listened to Owen, I'd go mad."
5018,Narrator,"Cain narrows his eyes of different colors, and walks closer to the tree. As Cain approaches, the person standing in the shadows slowly reveals himself. A ray of sunlight breaks through the clouds, illuminating his face. Skin as white as a ghost; one eye the color of pale blood, and the other glittering gold. It's Owen. He's smiling in delight."
5019,Owen,......Sir Knight......
5020,Cain,"Come on out, Owen......!"
5021,Narrator,"Cain tugs roughly at Owen's arm, pulling him towards himself. Owen looks surprised, and he falls to the ground on his knees. Cain is baffled, but Owen just gazes up at him in sheer joy."
5022,Owen,Sir Knight......
5023,Cain,What are you saying......? Everyone in the country is looking for you! What did you do to Captain Nicholas!?
5024,Owen,"Nicholas told me. He said that you're the strongest knight in the land, Cain."
5025,Cain,......Owen?
5026,Owen,"I thought that if I was a good boy, Sir Knight would come to save me. Did you come to save me?"
5027,Cain,What are you saying......?
5028,Narrator,"Cain, taken aback, releases Owen's hand. But as he does, Owen grabs back onto it like a child pestering him to play. His smile, bathed in the sunlight filtering through the leaves, looks unlike anything I've seen of Owen before. It's a smile full of pure hope."
5029,Owen,"A dark, damp place. There was nothing but rats and moles. That's where I lived. I was lonely, but I had a picture book. It was a book about Sir Knight that was half turned to dirt. He beats up bad guys, and saves people who are in trouble. He finally came. You finally came for me."
5030,Narrator,"Owen looks up at Cain with a pure smile spread across his face as his eyes shine with admiration. He reaches out to touch Cain's face with both his hands. Cain furrows his eyebrows, but he is frozen in place."
5031,Cain,...... What are you talking about? I won't fall for it. You've fooled me one too many times playing at weakness and sadness. And you also stole my eye.
5032,Narrator,"Talking about it seems to snap Cain back to his frustration with Owen, and he shakes off Owen's hands. Owen looks heartbroken. His eyes well up with tears; just watching him is enough to make me feel sad."
5033,Owen,......Why......
5034,Cain,Stop with your creepy acting! What are you up to!?
5035,Owen,"......Are you mad because I took your eye, Sir Knight......?"
5036,Cain,"Exactly! Your left eye belongs to me, you know!"
5037,Owen,......I'm sorry......
5038,Cain,"D... Did you just say sorry...? Hey, seriously, what's wrong, Owen......"
5039,Owen,I'll give it back to you right now...... So don't get mad......
5040,Cain,H... Hey......
5041,Narrator,"Owen looks down and, without hesitation, tries to jab his finger into his left eye."
5042,Owen,......Uu......
5043,Narrator,"Owen's face distorts with pain. Flustered, Cain grabs his arm."
5044,Cain,Stop! Stop it......!
5045,Owen,............
5046,Narrator,"Realizing that something must be wrong, I rush over to them."
5047,Akira,"......You're bleeding. Let's go treat your eye, Owen."
5048,Owen,......But......
5049,Narrator,"I look up at Cain, who shakes his head like he doesn't understand what's going on, and then sighs."
5050,Cain,....I'm not mad at you anymore. Let's fix you up.
5051,Narrator,Owen smiles.
5052,Narrator,"Once we're inside, Owen puts up with our ministrations in an unbelievably docile manner."
5053,Shino,"Oh, you hurt the white of your eye. Look this way. I'll do your eyedrops."
5054,Owen,Blep.
5055,Shino,You don't need to stick out your tongue.
5056,Owen,Are eyedrops scary?
5057,Shino,They're a piece of cake.
5058,Owen,Weh....!
5059,Shino,My bad. I missed.
5060,Owen,......No more eyedrop......
5061,Shino,Don't give up.
5062,Narrator,Heath nervously watches Shino as he applies Owen's eyedrops.
5063,Heathcliff,Amazing...... I can't believe Owen is obediently letting Shino do his eyedrops.....
5064,Cain,Just watching them is making me go mad...... Why in the world is this happening?
5065,Owen,"Sir Knight, Sir Knight."
5066,Cain,"......Er, what?"
5067,Owen,"I'll do my best with the eyedrops, so please watch me."
5068,Cain,............
5069,Heathcliff,He's really attached to you......
5070,Cain,I don't get it......
5071,Owen,"Sir Knight, Sir Knight."
5072,Heathcliff,Y... You should say something......
5073,Cain,Y... You got this~. I'm so proud of you. There. There.
5074,Owen,Ehehe...... Weh......!
5075,Shino,My bad. I missed again.
5076,Heathcliff,"You know, he would've killed you twice by now......"
5077,Owen,......I don't want to do this anymore......
5078,Shino,You got this. You can totally handle it.
5079,Cain,"You're doing great, I'm so proud of you~."
5080,Heathcliff,"Y... Yeah, you can do it~."
5081,Narrator,"Owen's cheeks end up dripping wet in the process, but Shino manages to finish administering the eyedrops."
5082,Cain,Are you okay?
5083,Owen,Um...... Shino sucks at eyedrops.
5084,Shino,Shut up.
5085,Cain,Can't you use magic? You stole my eye with magic. Don't stick your finger in your eye anymore.
5086,Owen,Nicholas said I was a wizard.
5087,Cain,Nicholas...... Do you remember what you guys talked about? Why did he fall?
5088,Owen,Um...... Because the town was destroyed.
5089,Cain,Because the town was destroyed......?
5090,Narrator,Owen smiles brightly and gives a tiny nod.
5091,Cain,Can you give me some details?
5092,Owen,Um...... Will you be proud of me if I remember?
5093,Cain,"Of course, of course. You got this."
5094,Narrator,Even Cain's flippant praise makes Owen happy.
5095,Owen,"Um...... Nicholas wanted to become a wizard. The wizards are keeping it a secret, but if the moon falls, everyone can become a wizard. That's why, it's better to accept the moon, instead of pushing it away...... That's what he was told."
5096,Akira,Who told him that......?
5097,Owen,Nova.
5098,Akira,Nova......
5099,Owen,"He helped with Nova's ritual, and that's what messed up the town. He said, ""It's my fault, I can't do this anymore, I'm going to take responsibility and leap from here,"" and then he leapt."
5100,Heathcliff,Take responsibility...... So that really was a suicide attempt?
5101,Shino,"Well, if you helped summon the < Great Catastrophe > and it ended up wrecking the whole world, I guess it would make you wanna die."
5102,Akira,"So Owen really never manipulated his heart...... If this was the Owen who was with Mister Nicholas back then, I can't imagine that he would've been capable of anything like that."
5103,Shino,So is this happening to Owen because of his bizarre injury from the < Great Catastrophe >?
5104,Heathcliff,"Most likely...... I can't believe Owen, who's like the embodiment of evil and fear, turned into this......"
5105,Shino,Isn't he better this way......?
5106,Heathcliff,You're right......
5107,Cain,"No, I prefer him as he usually is. This just makes things hard for me......"
5108,Owen,"Sir Knight, I remembered."
5109,Cain,"I'm so proud of you! I'm proud of you, and I'd also like you to remember a few more things. Who's Nova? What kind of guy is he?"
5110,Owen,Um......
5111,Cain,Did Nicholas say anything?
5112,Owen,............
5113,Narrator,"Owen's expression suddenly freezes. It's a face that I've seen before: he's frozen, as if at a loss. Cain is so focused on talking that he doesn't seem to realize."
5114,Cain,"Come on, Owen. Do your best, and try to remember. If you do, I'll praise you with my whole heart!"
5115,Owen,Oh......
5116,Narrator,Owen sneers and grabs Cain's chin.
5117,Cain,............!
5118,Owen,What are you going to praise me for? Sir Knight.
5119,Cain,This guy......
5120,Akira,Owen......!
5121,Narrator,"The usual Owen stands there, grinning as coldly as always. He looks around the room and begins to form a sentence. But at that moment, the door opens."
5122,Snow,Sage!
5123,White,"Sage, we figured it out! The identity of the Umbra Volans!"
5124,Heathcliff,"Sir Snow, Sir White."
5125,Snow,"Oh, Owen. I didn't realize you came back to the magic headquarters."
5126,Owen,............
5127,Narrator,"After a beat, Owen smiles leisurely."
5128,Owen,I can come back whenever I want.
5129,Cain,"Stop putting up a front. If this is the same as when Nicholas fell, you shouldn't remember anything about what happened just now."
5130,Owen,"......What do you mean, just now?"
5131,Cain,You were really attached to me.
5132,Shino,You let me do your eyedrops.
5133,Heathcliff,You wanted us to praise you......
5134,Snow,My goodness...... So Owen's bizarre injury completely changes his personality?
5135,White,Or perhaps it's his original.......
5136,Owen,Don't be ridiculous. At least come up with something better.
5137,Cain,"What about this damp, dark place?"
5138,Owen,............
5139,Cain,You said there was a picture book. Where a knight saves people who are in trouble......
5140,Owen,I have no clue what you're talking about.
5141,Snow,"Where are you going, Owen!"
5142,White,We need your cooperation! Something horrible is about to happen!
5143,Owen,Then there's really no reason for me to help. Because I love horrible things.
5144,Narrator,"Owen lifts his chin, a bone-chilling smile on his face."
5145,Owen,"The whole world should fall into madness - screaming, blood, and fear."
5146,Cain,Owen......!
5147,Narrator,"And like smoke, Owen vanishes."
5148,Cain,Dammit...... We were so close......
5149,Heathcliff,But we got some really important clues out of him. We should be able to figure out what's going on once we interrogate Nicholas.
5150,Shino,"Snow, White. What about the identity of the Umbra Volans?"
5151,Snow,< The Omen of Umbra Volans >.
5152,Shino,The Omen......?
5153,White,A spell that was sealed away in ancient times...... The Festival of the City of the Dead.
5154,Snow,"It is a large-scale summoning spell where the dead of the lost city are brought back to life, and every living being is offered up as fodder for their revival."
5155,White,< The Omen of Umbra Volans > is the bird that symbolizes the beginning of this festival.
5156,Snow,Judging from the time it appeared - the dead should begin coming back to life tonight.
5157,Cain,......Oh god...... But wasn't the ritual performed at the Lunar Eclipse Palace supposed to summon the moon?
5158,Snow,"They offered old human bones instead of living sacrifices, right? That's why the ritual transformed."
5159,White,Nicholas is a military man; his job is to protect the people. I suppose even he could not gather living humans.
5160,Heathcliff,"But according to the Western wizards, the same kind of ritual was conducted all over the world......"
5161,Shino,"Some of them must've actually used living humans. This Nova guy might have guided them from the shadows. Snow, White. How do we stop this Festival of the City of the Dead?"
5162,Snow,Look for the moonstone that was used as the medium.
5163,White,"Unless we purify the moonstone, the Umbra Volans will materialize, and the dead will start to come back to life."
5164,Shino,This is a great opportunity to make a name for myself. I'm headed to the capital.
5165,Cain,I'll go too. I need to report this to Prince Arthur.
5166,Heathcliff,"I'll join you. What will you do, Sir Snow and Sir White?"
5167,Snow,"Dusk is approaching. Once the sun has set, Oz cannot use magic."
5168,White,"Owen isn't around, so we need to secure Mithra's assistance. Sage, do help us convince him."
5169,Akira,I understand.
5170,Snow,"Thank you. Mithra has been very irritable lately, you see."
5171,White,It must be due to sleep deprivation. He needs to stop staying up all night......
5172,Akira,"Cain, Heathcliff, Shino. I'm counting on you."
5173,Shino,We're headed off.
5174,Heathcliff,"Please take care, Sir Sage!"
5175,Cain,I apologize for leaving your side. Please leave the capital to us.
5176,Akira,Got it! Please take care!
5177,Narrator,"The dead are coming back to life tonight...... I think of Snow and White's words, and a chill runs down my spine. I need to do what I can, and face each task in front of me in order to protect everyone. I take a deep breath and leave the room."
5178,Snow,"Mithra. Now, Mithra."
5179,Mithra,What is it now...... People certainly enjoy speaking to me today.
5180,White,This isn't the time to be lazing around. We're in serious trouble.
5181,Mithra,Whose trouble? Not mine.
5182,Snow,It will eventually be yours. Some people tried to summon the < Great Catastrophe >.
5183,Mithra,The < Great Catastrophe >......? Why? Are they perverts?
5184,Snow,Are they perverts?
5185,White,Maybe it's their kink?
5186,Akira,"W-we don't know what their goals are. But according to Owen, someone named Nova is involved."
5187,Mithra,Oh. I've never heard of him.
5188,Snow,"If we leave him alone, he might do the same thing again."
5189,White,"For now, the capital at Central is about to fall into grave danger. Could you lend us your strength?"
5190,Mithra,"No, that sounds like a pain......"
5191,Snow,"Mithra, dear!"
5192,White,"Mithra, dear! Be a good boy!"
5193,Mithra,"Couldn't you just ask Oz? That man can basically handle anything. Oh, right, he can't use his magic. How useless......"
5194,Oz,The sun is still up. I can easily cast a spell right now.
5195,Akira,Oz......
5196,Oz,"Would you like to see if I can control you as I wish, Mithra?"
5197,Mithra,And in turn I will make you my slave at night. Threatening me like this - you must have a request to make of me.
5198,Oz,I do not make requests. For wizards do not act on requests. I always follow my own will.
5199,Mithra,Exactly. I'll be a savior once a year - that's more than enough. I will spend the rest of the day sleeping.
5200,Oz,............ I see.
5201,Snow,O-Oz......
5202,White,Were you trying to persuade him without a plan in mind......?
5203,Oz,............
5204,Snow,"Oh dear. So you just made Mithra mad, then......"
5205,White,If only Oz had a tiny fraction of Figaro's silver tongue......
5206,Oz,......That's enough.
5207,Akira,Where are you going?
5208,Oz,I'll put an end to everything before night falls.
5209,Mithra,Oz. May I ask you something as well?
5210,Oz,......What is it.
5211,Mithra,"Why did you choose to serve? You used to be an emotionless, absolute ruler. Why should you care about the Central capital? You've been acting strange these past ten years or so. It's strange that you were summoned as a Central wizard in the first place. You're a Northern wizard through and through. You have no connections to Central Country whatsoever."
5212,Oz,............ There is no reason. I simply live as I please.
5213,Mithra,"Oh, is that so."
5214,Narrator,Oz turns to walk away. Mithra closes his eyes in boredom. I pause for a moment before deciding to tell Mithra.
5215,Akira,Oz...... I think Oz found something precious to him.
5216,Mithra,......Something precious?
5217,Akira,"What about you, Mithra? Don't you have something precious that you want to protect...... Could you please lend us your strength to protect that?"
5218,Snow,"Mithra's connections with other wizards are few and far in between, after all......"
5219,White,"He was close with Tiretta, but she has turned to stone."
5220,Akira,Tiretta......?
5221,Snow,The witch who raised Mithra like a mother.
5222,White,Weren't they lovers? Though Tiretta ultimately married a human.
5223,Narrator,Mithra raises his eyebrows at Tiretta's name.
5224,Mithra,"She was neither my mother nor my lover. Just an old, troublesome connection."
5225,Snow,"Is that so? When Tiretta found you as a child, she said, ""He's handsome, so I'll make him my lover."""
5226,White,"But then she said, ""He grew up to be a pathetic man, so I decided against it."""
5227,Mithra,What a rude woman.
5228,Snow,"On the other hand, the Southern brothers grew up to be such good children. Rutile and Mitile are both so amiable."
5229,Mithra,Rutile and Mitile? Do those two know Tiretta?
5230,White,"What are you saying? They're Tiretta's sons. You were invited to Rutile's birthday party, remember?"
5231,Mithra,Tiretta's sons......?
5232,Narrator,"Mithra's eyes open wide in shock. And then he jolts up, putting one hand to his mouth like he's just recalled something."
5233,Mithra,Ah......!
5234,Snow & White,Ah?
5235,Mithra,......This is bad......
5236,Narrator,"Mithra turns pale in an instant. He stands up at once, and lifts his hand. Hurriedly, he draws a large rectangle in the air like he's tracing an invisible door."
5237,Mithra,<< Arthim >>
5238,Narrator,"The next moment, a completely different sight lies before our eyes: it's as if only that particular segment of space has been torn out of the air. On the other side lies the Central capital."
5239,Snow,"So you're finally in the mood to help us, Mithra."
5240,White,"Right, right, teleportation is a piece of cake for you! So you're going to take us along?"
5241,Mithra,"No, this is a personal problem."
5242,Snow & White,"Mithra, dear......!!"
5243,Mithra,Excuse me.
5244,Narrator,"Before we know it, Mithra has vanished. The rest of us, left behind, just stare at the space where Mithra had been in blank amazement."
5245,Akira,We couldn't persuade him......
5246,Snow,"No, I think that's not quite true."
5247,Akira,What do you mean?
5248,White,Judging from how panicked Mithra was...... He might have made some kind of promise with Tiretta.
5249,Akira,Promise......?
5250,Snow,"Wizards use magic with their hearts. If they betray their hearts...... If they break a promise or a contract, they lose their magic."
5251,White,"That is why wizards do not make promises. Because when a wizard makes a promise he cannot keep, the mysterious powers he once controlled refuse to do his bidding."
5252,Snow,Tiretta predicted her own death before she gave birth to Mitile.
5253,White,There are only so many promises a mother would ask a powerful wizard to make if she foresaw her own death.
5254,Akira,A promise Mithra made with Tiretta......
5255,Narrator,"I recall what Rutile said to me before, and come to a realization. What a young wizard who was a friend of his mother's said to him as a child...... ""No matter what happens, I will protect you and your brother."""
5256,Rutile,"Sigh...... I guess Mister Mithra really forgot...... It happened a long time ago, after all. It makes me sad, but there's nothing I can do about it......"
5257,Riquet,<< Sunrotea Edif >>
5258,Central Country child,Woah...... Magic sugar......
5259,Riquet,It will help you recover your strength and lift your spirits - it can also work as a slight protection charm.
5260,Central Country man,How much should we pay you......?
5261,Riquet,No; I can't accept payment. Please make use of it.
5262,Central Country man,Thank you!
5263,Riquet,Fufu...... Everyone is happy.
5264,Mitile,"Riquet, your sugar is so neatly-shaped and pretty!"
5265,Riquet,"Mitile, your sugar was also solidly packed and very delicious!"
5266,Mitile,Ehehe. Let's trade later!
5267,Riquet,Let's!
5268,Figaro,"Sigh...... We still have lots of patients. There are fewer people with serious injuries now, but it looks like a lot of folks are having trouble sleeping."
5269,Rutile,I heard the same thing. Apparently there's an eerie sound coming from below the earth.
5270,Figaro,"The air kind of feels dark, too - there was more rubble last time we came, but it seemed more lively. ......Maybe it's because of the magic circle in the Lunar Eclipse Palace, but I'm also getting a really awful feeling. Bradley, do you notice anything? Huh? Bradley?"
5271,Bradley,"Alright, we made it inside. But what the hell's going on here......? The underlying balance is in complete chaos - there's no sense of order anywhere."
5272,Nero,"The Western wizards didn't make it sound this bad...... Maybe the contamination spread? Hey, I really think this is a bad idea, Bradley."
5273,Bradley,What are you saying? We already made it this far. Just leave it to Bradley the Great. Let's get started. First up is the treasury......
5274,Narrator,(Cawing)
5275,Bradley,......!
5276,Nero,......!
5277,Bradley,"Watch out, Nero!"
5278,Nero,I can sense it approaching. Here it comes. But from which direction......
5279,Narrator,(Cawing)
5280,Bradley,From below! It's gonna swallow our shadows......!
5281,Nero,<< Adnodus Omnis >>!
5282,Bradley,You all right!?
5283,Nero,What the hell was that!? The shadow just passed beneath our feet!
5284,Bradley,"It's slithering up along the walls. We can't crush it if it has no physical form. Come on out, you overgrown chicken! Is cock-a-doodle-doo all you know how to do!? If you face me fair and square, the great Bradley will be your opponent-.... ............!"
5285,Nero,Hey...... What the hell is that...... Something's coming out of the wall......
5286,Bradley,That hugeass beak......?
5287,Nero,Haha...... Isn't that nice. It wants to play with you.
5288,Bradley,"Hey, nobody told me it was gonna be such a huge fucking bird!"
5289,Narrator,(Cawing)
5290,Bradley,Run......!
5291,Nero,..........You're always like this! You taunt the enemy without thinking about what's going to happen next!
5292,Bradley,Just run!
5293,Nero,I'm never tagging along with you again!
5294,Bradley,"Okay, I get it! Let's leap out of that window! You take the right, I'll take the left! Let's go!"
5295,Narrator,(Crash)
5296,Narrator,(Cawing)
5297,Nero,......The Lunar Eclipse Palace is gonna fall apart!
5298,Bradley,"That bird is fucking gigantic! How did it fit into that palace!? Ah, dammit, it's coming this way......!"
5299,Nero,Yes! Right was the better window! I'm always choosing the right from now on!
5300,Bradley,Stop prattling on and help me out here....!
5301,Nero,"If you can turn it into grilled chicken, I'll carve it up nice and proper for you!"
5302,Bradley,"Tch......! I'll shoot you down with my rifle, you giant bird bastard! << Adnopotensum >> !"
5303,Narrator,(Bang)
5304,Nero,You hit it......!
5305,Narrator,(Cawing)
5306,Bradley,......It's running away. Ahaha! Take that!
5307,Nero,......Hey...... It's headed towards the capital......
5308,Bradley,What......?
5309,Nero,"......If that thing starts rioting in the city, it's gonna be a total disaster! I need to do something......!"
5310,Bradley,"What, you're going!? I thought you hated humans!? What a joke, Nero!"
5311,Nero,Shut up! You don't need to come with me!
5312,Bradley,"Hey......! ............ Tch...... Fine, fine..... I can't have some damn bird messing with the rubble that I cleared up! Wait up, Nero!"
5313,Central Country man,This wind feels really creepy...... It's all warm and moist like someone's breath......
5314,Central Country man,The sky is a really eerie color too...... It looks as red as a forest fire......
5315,Central Country man,"......Hey, don't you hear something......?"
5316,Central Country man,Don't scare me like that......
5317,Central Country man,But I can hear it...... It sounds like an army of bees buzzing...... Or an excited cow panting......
5318,Central Country man,"I want to go home before night falls, but it's getting dark already......"
5319,Central Country man,"......Ah, the sun is setting......"
5320,Narrator,(Hoot)
5321,Central Country soldier,Ugh...... What an awful night keep watch over the cemetery......
5322,Central Country soldier,We have no choice...... Sir Nicholas said that we can't let the wizards cause any more commotion.......
5323,Central Country soldier,......Ah.
5324,Central Country soldier,What......
5325,Central Country soldier,......Do you hear something......?
5326,Central Country soldier,"Cut it out, don't scare me......"
5327,Central Country soldier,"......Hey, don't you hear it...... It sounds like something wet being dragged along the ground, or like a frog being squashed...... Pitter patter....... A squelching sound......"
5328,Central Country soldier,H-hey......
5329,Central Country soldier,Do you hear it?
5330,Central Country soldier,B-behind you......
5331,Central Country soldier,Eh......?
5332,???,Grr...... Ggrrrr...... Roaaaarrrr.......!
5333,Central Country soldier,Aaaaahhhhh......!
5334,Figaro,......The wind changed.
5335,Rutile,Huh?
5336,Figaro,"Rutile, Mitile, Riquet. Gather your stuff. We're heading to the castle."
5337,Mitile,What about Mister Bradley?
5338,Figaro,He can probably manage. Things are looking pretty bad...... The chaos is spreading......
5339,Riquet,Is something going to happen? Should we warn the people?
5340,Figaro,"Tell them to close their doors and windows tight, and absolutely avoid going outside tonight."
5341,Riquet,Got i-....
5342,Central Country woman,Kyaah......!
5343,Central Country man,"Aaaaagh, run......!"
5344,Mitile,......! Everyone's running this way......! What happened over there!?
5345,Rutile,Are those...... The living dead......!?
5346,Central Country man,Help! Someone help me......!
5347,Living dead,Grrr......!
5348,Central Country woman,Eeeeeeek.....!
5349,Figaro,<< Possideo >>
5350,Living dead,Grrroar.......
5351,Central Country woman,......Thank you!
5352,Figaro,"Take caution and run. That goes for you three, too - flee with her!"
5353,Rutile,"What about you, Dr. Figaro!?"
5354,Figaro,Don't worry about me. Go on ahead first.
5355,Mitile,"B-but......! Please don't show off just because you're an adult! Dr. Figaro, you're not strong like the wizards from other countries, right!? I can't just leave you behind and run away......"
5356,Figaro,"Don't worry about me, Mitile. I'll catch up in no time."
5357,Mitile,"But, but......"
5358,Figaro,"Rutile, take care of Mitile and Riquet."
5359,Rutile,"......Got it. Dr. Figaro, please be safe!"
5360,Riquet,"Let's go, Mitile!"
5361,Mitile,Dr. Figaro......!
5362,Figaro,Be safe.
5363,Narrator,(Footsteps)
5364,Figaro,............
5365,Figaro,"Ah, this feels so good...... I was such a good person back there."
5366,Living dead,Grrr...... Gg...... Grrr......
5367,Figaro,"Now then, I'll take you on. I know, I know. You guys didn't want to be forced awake either - it's annoying, a real pain. But thanks to you, I looked pretty good. That's why, as my way of showing gratitude...... I'll gently turn you to dust. << Possideo >>"
5368,Living dead,Grrooarr......!
5369,Narrator,(Flash of light)
5370,Living dead,Grrrrrh.......!
5371,Narrator,(Flash of light)
5372,Living dead,Kaaaah......!
5373,Heathcliff,The living dead......!
5374,Cain,Dammit! We didn't make it in time!
5375,Living dead,Grr...... Grrr......
5376,Heathcliff,"Shino, watch out!"
5377,Shino,<< Matztzāh Sudipas >>!
5378,Heathcliff,"They're coming from under the bridge, too...... .......hh. << Repsevaivulp Sonus >>!"
5379,Cain,"Yeah, thanks to their rotting smell. Let me know if a citizen walks by."
5380,Heathcliff,Got it!
5381,Cain,I'll protect this castle - I swear on my honor as the leader of the Order of Knights! Even if they took away my title.
5382,Living dead,Roar......
5383,Cain,There you are! << Gladius Procella >>!
5384,Living dead,Roar...... Guh......
5385,Shino,You're pretty good.
5386,Cain,Naturally.
5387,Heathcliff,......! Someone's coming from the sky......!
5388,Cain,A wizard!?
5389,Shino,No. That's......
5390,Nicholas,............
5391,Shino,Nicholas......!
5392,Cain,......!? Nicholas!?
5393,Heathcliff,But something's wrong...... His limbs are twisted into black wings......
5394,Shino,Tch...... It's taken over his body. That guy's done for.
5395,Cain,Nicholas......
5396,Nicholas,Grr...... Roar...... Roaaaar......!
5397,Heathcliff,......!
5398,Shino,Heath!
5399,Narrator,(Splash)
5400,Cain,Where's Heath!? Is he all right!?
5401,Shino,"He fell under the bridge! Heath! Heathcliff, answer me......!"
5402,Nicholas,Roaaaar......!
5403,Living dead,Roaaaar...... Grrrrr......
5404,Cain,......This looks like trouble.
5405,Nicholas,Roaaaar......!
5406,Narrator,(Footsteps)
5407,Mitile,Pant... Pant... Will Dr. Figaro be all right!?
5408,Rutile,"He's a brilliant man, so I'm sure he'll be okay! Riquet, can you still run?"
5409,Riquet,......Yes! But may I ask a question......!?
5410,Rutile,"Yes, go on!"
5411,Riquet,Why are we running instead of flying......!?
5412,Mitile,............ Good point......
5413,Rutile,I got swept up because everyone else was running.....
5414,Skinny Central Country child,......Uu......
5415,Rutile,Ah...... It's the child who's keeping Mister Mithra's package.....
5416,Skinny Central Country child,......Uuu......
5417,Rutile,"He might be injured...... I'll quickly check on him! If anything happens, you two should take to the skies!"
5418,Mitile,Nii-sama!
5419,Skinny Central Country child,Uu...... Uuu......
5420,Rutile,Are you okay? You look so pale...... And your hands are so cold...... Are you carrying Mister Mithra's package by your stomach......? Was it always this big......?
5421,Skinny Central Country child,Don't touch me...... Uu...... ......Mine...... It's mine......
5422,Rutile,"Yours......? ...... Sorry, I'm going to roll up your shirt."
5423,Skinny Central Country child,Don't touch me...... Don't touch me......!
5424,Rutile,........ ............! This is......
5425,Mitile,Nii-sama! Was he okay? .........!
5426,Riquet,His stomach is swollen...... Like a snake that swallowed an egg......
5427,Skinny Central Country child,Uu...... So long as I keep this in my stomach...... It'll become mine...... Mister Mithra gave me...... My jewel......
5428,Rutile,Mister Mithra...... Mister Mithra put a jewel in your stomach?
5429,Mithra,That's right.
5430,Rutile,......Mister Mithra......
5431,Mithra,"You ran away, so I was forced to search for you."
5432,Skinny Central Country child,Uu...... It's mine......
5433,Mithra,You've been possessed by desire. I suppose the stone was too valuable for a child like you.
5434,Rutile,This child...... What's going to happen to him......?
5435,Mithra,He'll die. Because I'm slicing open his stomach to take out the stone.
5436,Rutile,How could you......
5437,Mitile,Mister Mithra! That's awful! I can't believe you'd do that to such a small child......
5438,Mithra,............
5439,Riquet,"Mitile, watch out!"
5440,Mitile,Huh?
5441,Rutile,"<< Ortonik Setomaouge >>! ......Mister Mithra, I can't believe you attacked Mitile......!"
5442,Mithra,I'm going to need all of you to die.
5443,Rutile,Eh......?
5444,Mithra,Hand over that child.
5445,Rutile,I can't! Ah......
5446,Narrator,(Clash)
5447,Mitile,Nii-sama......!
5448,Riquet,Rutile......!
5449,Rutile,"I'm all right! Run away, you two! I'm going to take this child and escape from here!"
5450,Skinny Central Country child,Uu......
5451,Mithra,You won't get away from me.
5452,Rutile,"Why don't you try keeping up with me in the sky, then! Let's go. Don't worry; there's nothing to be afraid of."
5453,Skinny Central Country child,......Uu...... My stomach hurts......
5454,Rutile,<< Ortonik Setomaouge >>!
5455,Mitile,Nii-sama......!
5456,Rutile,Both of you run! Head towards the castle!
5457,Mithra,Hand over that child.
5458,Rutile,"I refuse! I'm taking him to Dr. Figaro! Mister Mithra, you're awful...... I knew you were a Northern wizard, but...... I never expected you to do something so horrible! I'll forget every last memory I have of you, and......"
5459,Mithra,How would you like to die?
5460,Rutile,You aren't even listening to me!
5461,Mithra,Would you like to be burned to death? Or would you rather be roasted to a crisp by lightning? Let's try both.
5462,Rutile,......! Aaagh......
5463,Mithra,"Looks like you avoided a direct strike, but you can no longer keep flying."
5464,Skinny Central Country child,Uu...... Aah...... We're falling......We're falling......
5465,Rutile,......Don't worry....! I'll take you somewhere safe! Ugh...... He scorched my right arm...... But I need to keep flying......
5466,Mithra,He's tough.
5467,Narrator,(Flash)
5468,Rutile,Ugh......!
5469,Skinny Central Country child,Uu......
5470,Mithra,A powerless yet troublesome eyesore...... You're just like a pest.
5471,Rutile,"......That monkey's arm you gave me was plenty pathetic as well......! I was so scared of it as a child! I thought it was creepy, but you told me to take good care of it, so I even kept it by my pillow....!"
5472,Mithra,It's time for you to die.
5473,Rutile,"When Mother died, when Father died - when it was just Mitile and me - you were my heart's anchor, Uncle Mithra! But you've forgotten it all, and now you're messing everything up - Mister Mithra, you crappy idiot!!"
5474,Mithra,I do remember.
5475,Rutile,......!? Two Mister Mithras......!?
5476,Mithra,I will protect you. << Arthim >>
5477,Rutile,......!
5478,Akira,......! That flash of red in the sky just now......
5479,Oz,It's Mithra.
5480,Akira,Huh?
5481,Snow,Glad to know that he's nearby.
5482,White,But he might end up wrecking half the capital.
5483,Akira,Huh!?
5484,Oz,Mithra doesn't know how to hold back......
5485,Snow,"Well, it's better than letting this place become a capital of the dead."
5486,White,"Now, let's hurry to Arthur's side."
5487,Rutile,Th-the city is in ruins......
5488,Mithra,"Sigh...... My goodness, that was close. It looks like my doppelganger has also disappeared."
5489,Rutile,"I-I can't believe you! You're lucky everyone already fled to safety - if someone had still been outside, they would've been terribly injured!"
5490,Mithra,"Okay...... I only need to protect you, so."
5491,Rutile,Wh......
5492,Mithra,Where's the little brother? I need to find him and collect him.
5493,Rutile,Collect?
5494,Mithra,"That's right. I'm going to seal you two away and bury you deep underground in permafrost. I promised to protect you two, but I can't keep an eye on you all the time. If something happens to you, I'll lose my magic; I can't have that. Goodness...... I'm in so much trouble because I made that promise with Tiretta."
5495,Narrator,(Slap)
5496,Mithra,........... Hah......? Did you just punch me? A mere Southern wizard punched me.....?
5497,Rutile,......I did punch you. I apologize.
5498,Mithra,What?
5499,Rutile,"That's not what a promise is. Your heart is moved, your heart is resolved, and your heart binds the promise. Even in this world that is full of uncertainty, there are some things - some people - you can trust from the bottom of your heart. That is what a promise embodies. Did you promise Mother that you would seal me and Mitile away? Did you promise her that nobody else mattered, apart from the two of us?"
5500,Mithra,I didn't make a promise because I wanted to.
5501,Rutile,Then you don't need to protect us anymore. Just leave us alone.
5502,Mithra,I can't just do that - that's the problem!?
5503,Rutile,"If it's such a problem, then you never should've promised her anything in the first place! Why did you make a promise with Mother!?"
5504,Mithra,............ ......Tiretta said that she was probably going to die soon.
5505,Rutile,............
5506,Mithra,"I've lived a long life, so I'm used to parting ways with people. But I had known her for a long time, so...... Maybe I wanted to do something that would make Tiretta happy before we said goodbye."
5507,Rutile,Mister Mithra.....
5508,Mithra,"Tiretta was like a master to me. She taught me magic; she taught me how to live. She had no common sense, and she was an absolutely wild woman, but......"
5509,Rutile,Don't speak so rudely of my mother.
5510,Mithra,"......... When I told her, ""I will protect your children,"" Tiretta looked so happy......"
5511,Rutile,"......I'm sorry for yelling at you. Mister Mithra, you really cared for Mother in your own way. Just hearing your feelings...... That alone was enough to make me really happy."
5512,Mithra,Rutile......
5513,Skinny Central Country child,Uu......
5514,Rutile,"This is bad...... Mister Mithra, can you remove whatever is in this boy's stomach?"
5515,Mithra,Can I slice his stomach open?
5516,Rutile,I want to save him. Can you save him even if you have to slice his stomach open?
5517,Mithra,I've never really tried that. Will you complain if I mess up?
5518,Rutile,Um...... How about this? Can you find Dr. Figaro for me?
5519,Mithra,Certainly. That would be easy. <<Arth......>> ............!
5520,Rutile,Mister Mithra......!
5521,Mithra?,"I see the rumors about you were true, Mithra of the North. But......"
5522,???,You're no match for me.
5523,Mithra,......Who are you?
5524,Nova,Nova. Mithra of the North. I'll leave you my name as a farewell gift.
5525,Central Country soldier,Prince Arthur! The people are surging towards the castle! They speak of strange incidents......
5526,Arthur,"Open the castle gates, and let the people take refuge inside the castle."
5527,Vincent,Are you inviting people into the castle!? What happens if something nefarious sneaks in with them......
5528,Arthur,"Uncle, please speak no further. Set up accommodations at once."
5529,Vincent,What!?
5530,Arthur,"The cemetery, the Lunar Eclipse Palace - we warned you over and over again, Uncle! And yet you refused to listen each time! I hear you ordered the guards to hide what happened to Nicholas as well. Your actions brought this tragedy upon us. I will have you take responsibility."
5531,Vincent,Someone like you has no right to.......!
5532,Arthur,"Did you just say ""someone like me""?"
5533,Vincent,............
5534,Arthur,I am the successor to the crown of Central Country - the First Prince Arthur! Know your place!
5535,Vincent,......Yes......
5536,Arthur,"Oh no, I got too worked up...... They're going to start rumors about how terrifying wizards are again...... Hm? Someone's outside the window......"
5537,Snow in the portrait,Arthur!
5538,White in the portrait,Arthur!
5539,Arthur,"Sir Snow, Sir White! Sir Sage, and Sir Oz too......! I'm glad you're all safe!"
5540,Oz,"The twins are trapped inside the frame, but yes, we are fine. Is everything all right on your end?"
5541,Arthur,"No, things are looking quite terrible. The city is overrun with the living dead......"
5542,Snow in the portrait,Arthur. Oz just wanted to know whether you were hurt.
5543,Arthur,"Ah...... No, I'm not hurt anywhere. I'm doing fine!"
5544,Oz,"I see. The sun has set. I cannot be of much help, but the twins will lend you their strength instead."
5545,Snow in the portrait,"Arthur. In the worst case scenario, the city will become a capital of death, overrun by the living dead."
5546,White in the portrait,We shall set up a barrier around this castle. Let us lend you our strength.
5547,Arthur,Thank you! There is just one more thing I'd like to ask of you......
5548,Snow in the portrait,What is it?
5549,Arthur,Drummond and the Magical Technology Corps are working together to hold off the invasion of the dead. I would like to send them reinforcements......
5550,White in the portrait,Do not worry. We have already sent powerful support their way.
5551,Living dead,Roar....... Gr...... Grrrr......
5552,Drummond,......W-we're surrounded......
5553,Cock Robin,Sir Drummond...! They've broken through the barricade!
5554,Drummond,I-I see. Have the citizens all fled?
5555,Cock Robin,Yes......
5556,Drummond,"I'm sorry, Cock Robin. You're a newly-wed man, and yet I made you come along......"
5557,Cock Robin,"What are you saying, Sir Drummond!? We're getting out of this alive!"
5558,Living dead,Roar......!
5559,Cock Robin,Aaah! Here they come!
5560,Drummond,"Run, Cock Robin! I'll hold them back......!"
5561,Cock Robin,B-but......!
5562,Drummond,Just go!
5563,Living dead,Roar......!
5564,Drummond,Eeek.....
5565,Cock Robin,Sir Drummond......!
5566,Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
5567,Cock Robin,H-huh!? Sir Drummond disappeared!?
5568,Drummond,Squeak! Squeak squeak!
5569,Murr,"That was surprising! You looked like you were about to get eaten, so I made you a mouse!"
5570,Cock Robin,Sir Drummond! Thank goodness you're safe......!
5571,Drummond,Squeak! Squeak squeak!
5572,Living dead,Guh...... Gr...... Grrr.......
5573,Shylock,"The flocking, maniacal dead...... This isn't a very beautiful sight."
5574,Rustica,I suppose this means I won't have to look for my bride right now.
5575,Chloe,"Mister Drummond, Mister Cock Robin! You guys have been through so much! Leave the rest to us!"
5576,Cock Robin,The Western wizards!
5577,Drummond,Squee squeak!
5578,Shylock,Grab ahold of your pen. We'll show you a series of miracles so bountiful that you won't be able to keep up.
5579,Rustica,"Oh, it's going to be on the record? Then I guess I need to show off a little."
5580,Chloe,Eh~! I would've worn my new clothes if I had known!
5581,Cock Robin,Y-you are all so relaxed.
5582,Murr,"Of course! We're wizards, after all!"
5583,Living dead,Roar........ Guh...... Grrr.......
5584,Mitile,"Pant, pant...... << Ortonik Sealsispilce >>!"
5585,Riquet,"Mitile, are you okay?"
5586,Mitile,I-I think I'm going to trip over my tongue......
5587,Riquet,"Mitile, your spell seems so difficult to chant......"
5588,Mitile,"I said the same thing to Dr. Figaro, but he said we should stick with this......"
5589,Living dead,Roar...... Guh...... Grrr.......
5590,Riquet,Here they come again!
5591,Mitile,"......Riquet, please try attacking them!"
5592,Riquet,"B-but, I've never used magic to attack anything! Father Priest forbade me......"
5593,Mitile,Now's not the time for that!
5594,Riquet,You're right......
5595,Mitile,Imagine something powerful! Give it a go!
5596,Riquet,Something powerful...... A tornado......? A big tornado......
5597,Living dead,Roar......!
5598,Mitile,Aaah.......!
5599,Riquet,............ << Sunrotea Edif >>!
5600,Narrator,(Woosh)
5601,Living dead,......Guaaah.......!
5602,Riquet,......!
5603,Mitile,"......! Th-that was some amazing force, Riquet!"
5604,Riquet,......That felt good......
5605,Mitile,Huh?
5606,Riquet,I-it's nothing! Ah......!
5607,Mitile,Wh-what should we do! There's so many of them in front......!
5608,Riquet,They're going to attack us from both sides!
5609,Living dead,Roar....... Guh...... Gyaah.......
5610,Riquet,<< Sunrotea Edif >>!
5611,Mitile,<< Ortonik Sealsi...... >>! ......I bit my tongue!
5612,Living dead,Roar...... Guh....... Gyaah......
5613,Riquet,Mitile!
5614,Mitile,............! No! I don't want to die......! If only...... If only I had great power......
5615,Bradley,<< Adnopotensum >>!
5616,Mitile,...........!
5617,Narrator,(Bam) (Bam)
5618,Living dead,.......Guh........!
5619,Nero,<<Adnodus Omnis >>!
5620,Living dead,Gah...... Guh.......!
5621,Riquet,Nero!
5622,Mitile,Mister Bradley!
5623,Nero,Are you all right!?
5624,Bradley,"That was a close call, you Central and Southern tinies."
5625,Mitile,"Where were you all this time, Mister Bradley!? I thought you came to do volunteer work!?"
5626,Bradley,"Hey, I saved you; that counts as volunteer work. Want me to charge you?"
5627,Mitile,"I thought you were cool for a second there, but nevermind! You're the worst!"
5628,Riquet,"Nero, why were you here?"
5629,Nero,I was doing some soul-searching?
5630,Riquet,Soul-searching......?
5631,Mitile,"Mister Bradley, Mister Nero! Please save my brother!"
5632,Nero,Was he attacked by the dead?
5633,Mitile,He was attacked by Mister Mithra......
5634,Nero,"Mithra, huh......"
5635,Bradley,I don't wanna fight Mithra. That guy doesn't know a thing about chivalry or justice.
5636,Riquet & Mitile,Please save him!
5637,Nero & Bradley,Uhh......
5638,Shino,"Heath! Heath, where are you!?"
5639,Living dead,Roar....... Guh.......
5640,Shino,Shut up and get out of my way! << Matztzāh Sudipas >>!
5641,Living dead,.......Roar.......
5642,Shino,......Heath......! These are...... Heath's clothes......?
5643,Narrator,(Low growling)
5644,Shino,............ Heath......?
5645,Narrator,(Swords clanging)
5646,Cain,......Nicholas! We'll settle this once and for all!
5647,Nicholas,Roar......
5648,Cain,......The wind pierces like sharp feathers...... I heard you wanted to be a wizard! Are you satisfied now that you've become a monster who can use magic!?
5649,Nicholas,Roar......
5650,Cain,"...... If you admired wizards, why didn't you say so!? If you had told us, we would've opened up our hearts! If you admired us, then why did you trample on us!? I admired you too! That's why I trained so hard - and surpassed you! Is that something only a wizard can do!? Of course not, right, Nicholas!?"
5651,Nicholas,Roar......
5652,Cain,<< Gladius Procella >>!
5653,Nicholas,......Gaahh......! ......Ahh......
5654,Cain,I'll grant you this final mercy: I'll end you before you shame yourself in front of Prince Arthur. With this very sword.
5655,Shino,Cain! Watch out......!
5656,Cain,......!?
5657,Cain,A...... black panther......!?
5658,Shino,It's Heath!
5659,Cain,This thing!?
5660,Shino,"He smells the same, and his eyes are the same color, too! I thought he transformed with magic, but that's not it!"
5661,Cain,What do you mean!?
5662,Shino,He attacks us!
5663,Cain,Seriously!?
5664,Narrator,(Growling)
5665,Cain,......Ugh......! He leapt onto me!
5666,Shino,Hold him down! I'll put him to sleep right now! << Matztzāh Sudi...... >>!
5667,Narrator,(Growling)
5668,Shino,......I told you to hold him down!
5669,Cain,"He was about to bite me! I can't just punch him, right!?"
5670,Shino,Why did this happen!? Is it because of the living dead!? Did he eat something weird!?
5671,Cain,No! Look at the back of his hip. His crest is darker than usual. This is probably......
5672,Shino,......! His bizarre injury from the < Great Catastrophe >......
5673,Narrator,(Growling)
5674,Shino,......Got it. I'll get through to him with words. We've been together for a long time. I won't let some < Great Catastrophe > get between us out of nowhere.
5675,Cain,"The < Great Catastrophe > existed way before you two were born, you know!"
5676,Shino,"Heath, listen closely. I wished for you to become arrogant. But not like this. You understand, right?"
5677,Narrator,(Growling)
5678,Shino,......Look at that. You know how to yell real loud.
5679,Cain,......! Where's Nicholas!? Nicholas is gone!
5680,Shino,"Heath, please come back to your senses. I don't want to hurt you. Please, I'm begging you."
5681,Narrator,(Growling)
5682,Shino,Heath......!
5683,Living dead,Roar...... Guh...... Grrr......
5684,Lennox,"<< Forsettao Meiuvat >> Go, little sheep. Graze away at them like grass."
5685,Lennox's sheep,Baaa! Baa baa!
5686,Lennox,"Are you all right, Sir Faust?"
5687,Faust,Of course. But I never thought we'd run into this kind of uproar on our way back from Eastern Country......
5688,Lennox,It might be better to meet with Prince Arthur before we return to the magic headquarters.
5689,Faust,"Arthur, huh."
5690,Lennox,Would you rather not? He does look like Sir Ale-mghgh.
5691,Faust,Shut up.
5692,Lennox's sheep,Baa baa! Baa baa!
5693,Lennox,They came back.
5694,Faust,They're cute......
5695,Lennox,Did you just say something?
5696,Faust,No. ......Lennox. Look upwards.
5697,Lennox,Up......? ............! That's......!?
5698,Murr,The moon......
5699,Rustica,What's this? The moon is being covered......
5700,Chloe,That's not a cloud.........
5701,Shylock,Is that tremendous bird the Umbra Volans......?
5702,Cock Robin,Th...... That thing is going to cover the whole castle......
5703,Arthur,...........! So that is the shadowy bird that destroyed the Central tower......
5704,Akira,I didn't realize it was this big......
5705,Snow in the portrait,Here it comes.
5706,White in the portrait,"Well then, Arthur. We will be heading off."
5707,Arthur,"Sir Snow, Sir White......"
5708,Snow in the portrait,No need to worry. We will protect this castle with our barrier.
5709,White in the portrait,"We're leaving the rest to you, Oz."
5710,Oz,............
5711,Narrator,"The twins step out of the portrait at the same time. And they fly upwards without using brooms. Like a large pair of wings protecting the castle, they float into the night sky and close their eyes. They clutch their dolls - which appeared from nowhere - to their chests, and murmur at the same time."
5712,Snow & White,Here we go-.... << Noscomnia >>
5713,Narrator,"A gentle light radiates from the two of them. The light spreads outwards and falls around them, encompassing the castle like a snowdome. The sight is so mystically beautiful that, for a moment, all my fear and anxiety falls away. The people who have gathered to take refuge in the castle breathe sighs of admiration."
5714,Central Country child,......It's so pretty......
5715,Central Country man,Don't worry...... The wizards will protect us all.
5716,Central Country man,Just as they protected us from the < Great Catastrophe >......
5717,Narrator,"After gazing up at the twins, a quiet determination settles across Arthur's face. He turns around and says to me-...."
5718,Arthur,Sir Sage. I will go out as well. I will divert the bird's attention to keep Sir Snow and Sir White's barrier from being destroyed.
5719,Akira,Arthur......
5720,Arthur,"Please do not worry about me. I am Sir Oz's pupil, after all."
5721,Narrator,Arthur smiles and looks up at Oz.
5722,Arthur,"Isn't that right, Sir Oz?"
5723,Oz,............
5724,Narrator,"Oz gazes at Arthur without uttering a word. Oz's silence frustrates me. I wish he would just say something to Arthur. But after spending some time with him, I've come to understand him bit by bit. Oz treasures words. Because he's a wizard who treasures promises. Wizards do not make promises. For if they break their promises, they lose their power. That means...... They are very sincere and honest. How many promises have I made that I knew I would break - because I was carried away by the situation, and wanted to take the easy way out to make someone happy? Every time I broke a promise, I hurt someone, and I hurt myself. The wizards in this world don't do that. They don't sell their words short or throw them around lightly."
5725,Oz,Be careful.
5726,Arthur,Yes. Please take care of Sir Sage.
5727,Narrator,"Arthur stands on the balcony, taking out his broom. The people look up at his figure and break out in cheers. Their voices are by turns straightforward, by turns selfish - yet Arthur smiles through it all."
5728,Arthur,I will be going now.
5729,Narrator,Arthur soars into the sky. Towards the terrifying bird.
5730,Central Country man,It's Prince Arthur!
5731,Central Country man,Prince Arthur will save us!
5732,Central Country woman,"Be careful, Prince Arthur!"
5733,Central Country man,Do your best......!
5734,Oz,............
5735,Narrator,Oz watches Arthur's back flying into the distance as if it's a blinding sight.
5736,Cain,There's a barrier around the castle......! It must be Sir Snow and Sir White!
5737,Shino,.....Now we just need Heath to get back to normal....!
5738,Living dead,Guh...... Grrr....... Gggh.... Grr.......
5739,Cain,The dead keep coming...... Looks like they headed this way after being repelled by the barrier.
5740,Shino,"We sure are popular tonight. Heath! It's me, Shino! Please return to your real self......!"
5741,Narrator,(Heath growling)
5742,Shino,............!
5743,Cain,"Are you all right, Shino!?"
5744,Shino,......He just gave me a little scratch.
5745,Cain,You're bleeding horribly. You've done enough; you should run awa......
5746,Living dead,Roar...... Guh......
5747,Cain,......They're so persistent!
5748,Owen,<< Cure Memini >>
5749,Cain,............!
5750,Living dead,......Aaa......
5751,Shino,The dead turned to dust in an instant......
5752,Cain,Owen......
5753,Owen,Hey. Is that beast Heathcliff?
5754,Shino,.......He's not a beast.
5755,Owen,He is a beast. Did you know I get along with beasts? I can make them serve me as I please.
5756,Cain,You! Don't you dare lay a finger on Heath! I won't forgi-....
5757,Owen,What can you do?
5758,Cain,...........
5759,Owen,You're powerless. I'll ask again: what can you do? Stand back. You're in the way.
5760,Shino,......Don't get near him! << Matztzāh Sudipas >>!
5761,Owen,<< Cuare Morito >>
5762,Shino,......! My legs...... I can't move!
5763,Cain,"I can't move my legs either...... Stop it, Owen! I'm begging you, please stop......!"
5764,Shino,"Heath! Heath, run......!"
5765,Owen,"Haha...... Come here, Heathcliff."
5766,Shino,......Heath calmed down......
5767,Cain,......Is he speaking to him......?
5768,Owen,"There, there...... Good boy. You're so cute, rubbing your cheek against my hand. Aren't you getting sleepy? That's right...... Playtime is over."
5769,Heathcliff,............ ......Nn......
5770,Cain,He's back to normal......!
5771,Shino,Heath! ...... I can move my legs......
5772,Owen,I've returned the favor. Don't you dare tell anyone about what happened to me before.
5773,Faust,Someone's headed towards the bird...... It's Arthur......
5774,Lennox,Sir Faust! There's a man with what looks like wings over there!
5775,Nicholas,Guh...... Grrr......
5776,Lennox,It's Nicholas from the Magical Technology Corps. Does he intend to fuse with the bird......?
5777,Faust,Hmph. << Satillquinart Mullcreed >>
5778,Nicholas,......Roar......! Gaahhh......!
5779,Lennox,He's coming this way.
5780,Faust,Is that so? How troublesome. I had absolutely no intention of helping Alec's descendant.
5781,Lennox,"You're a terrible liar, as always."
5782,Faust,Whatever. He's coming; get ready.
5783,Lennox,Yes.
5784,Nicholas,Roar......!
5785,Lennox,<< Forsettao Meiuvat >>
5786,Nicholas,Guh......! Roar......!
5787,Lennox,......! He broke through the spell!
5788,Faust,Leno!
5789,Nicholas,Roar......!
5790,Lennox,......Take this......!
5791,Narrator,(Thump)
5792,Nicholas,......Guh......!
5793,Lennox,............Hmph.
5794,Faust,......You're a wizard. Why did you default to close combat? Use magic.
5795,Lennox,I'm sorry...... I just punched him reflexively......
5796,Nicholas,Roar......!
5797,Faust,That's enough. I'll put an end to you. It's time for you to fall into a deep slumber. << Satillquinart Mullcreed >>
5798,Nicholas,Roar......!
5799,Faust,............ He turned to dust...... So he didn't become stone.
5800,Figaro,"Nicely done. Faust, Lennox."
5801,Lennox,Dr. Figaro.
5802,Faust,Stop spectating and help us out.
5803,Figaro,"You didn't need my help. By the way, have you seen Rutile and the others?"
5804,Mithra,............
5805,Rutile,Mister Mithra......!
5806,Mithra,Impossible...... How could I be overwhelmed by any wizard aside from Oz......? Who are you? I should have at least heard of you if your magic is this powerful. Nobody knows of a wizard named Nova.
5807,Nova,"I have no business with you. Rutile of the South, hand over that child."
5808,Rutile,I-I refuse......!
5809,Skinny Central Country child,......Uu......
5810,Mithra,Are you absolutely sure about this? Can't we just hand him over......?
5811,Rutile,"M-Mister Mithra, you can run away! I'll protect this child myself!"
5812,Nova,"Well then, I'll take him by force."
5813,Mithra,"......I won't let you. I can't have him turning to stone, you see."
5814,Bradley,Mithra!
5815,Nero,"Rutile, are you okay!?"
5816,Mithra,"......! Bradley, Nero. Good timing......"
5817,Bradley,<< Adnopotensum >>!
5818,Mithra,Guh......
5819,Rutile,M-Mister Mithra......!
5820,Bradley,"Hah......! I got him! Mithra's a difficult opponent, but the three of us can probably handle him together."
5821,Nero,"Yeah. I don't know who you are, but you put up a good fight. Good job."
5822,Nova,............
5823,Rutile,N-No! Mister Mithra saved me! That wizard is the one who ruined the whole capital!
5824,Bradley,What!?
5825,Nero,This guy!?
5826,Mithra,"......Cough...... Bradley, Nero...... You really did it this time......"
5827,Bradley & Nero,"Sorry, sorry!"
5828,Nova,Stop this charade. This is the end.
5829,Rutile,......!
5830,Mithra,<< Arthim >> Rutile. Escape through this door.
5831,Rutile,But......
5832,Mithra,"Come on, hurry. Please, don't die."
5833,Rutile,......All right.....!
5834,Mitile,"I wonder if Mister Bradley and Mister Nero are okay. They said not to follow them, but......"
5835,Riquet,......I hope nothing scary happens......
5836,Lennox,"Mitile, Riquet."
5837,Mitile,Mister Lennox......!
5838,Figaro,Are you two all right?
5839,Faust,"Two children, alone in a place like this......?"
5840,Riquet,"Figaro, Faust...... Bradley and Nero flew towards the sky over there to save Rutile!"
5841,Figaro,To save Rutile? From whom?
5842,Mitile,Mister Mithra!
5843,Narrator,(Flash)
5844,Rutile,............!
5845,Mitile,Nii-sama...! Are you all right!?
5846,Rutile,"Mitile, Riquet......"
5847,Figaro,You're injured.
5848,Rutile,"Dr. Figaro, please save this child!"
5849,Rutile,Something has been buried inside his stomach! Some wizard named Nova did it......
5850,Faust,Nova......?
5851,Skinny Central Country child,......Uu......
5852,Figaro,......This is...... The moonstone is inside him.....
5853,Riquet,The moonstone....?
5854,Faust,The young wizards should stay away from him. There's a horrendous amount of chaos spinning within him. It'll affect you.
5855,Lennox,"Come over here, Mitile, Riquet. Rutile, are you feeling okay?"
5856,Rutile,Y-Yes...... Can you save this child?
5857,Figaro,"Don't worry, Dr. Figaro is a skilled physician. ...But goodness, this is terrible. I can't believe he hid the medium inside a human body. Faust, please purify the surrounding area. Chaos will erupt the very moment I remove the moonstone. We need to ensure the order of this place isn't contaminated."
5858,Faust,Leave it to me. << Satillquinart Mullcreed >>
5859,Riquet,Ah...... It feels easier to breathe now......
5860,Rutile,You can do it..... You'll feel better very soon.
5861,Figaro,Let's begin. There's nothing to be afraid of.
5862,Skinny Central Country child,......Uu...... Uu...... No...... This is...... Mine......
5863,Figaro,Shh. Quiet.
5864,Skinny Central Country child,......Don't steal it from me......!
5865,Mitile,......Wh-what's wrong......?
5866,Skinny Central Country child,Fufu...... It's my jewel...... Mine...... Mine......
5867,Figaro,It's not yours.
5868,Skinny Central Country child,It's mine...... Uu......
5869,Figaro,"You have been swallowed by your role. You were made to take care of the moonstone - but that is not who you are. You have a name, don't you?"
5870,Skinny Central Country child,......Uu......
5871,Figaro,"Tell me your name. Even without the jewel - you are still you. You shine more beautifully than the moon. I know it's difficult to forget how you felt when that beautiful jewel was in your hands. But remember how you used to smile. You smiled happily, even without the jewel. That's what you need to take back. Remember your true self. What is your name?"
5872,Skinny Central Country child,......Jude......
5873,Figaro,"Jude. What a wonderful name for a hard worker. You're a hero, Jude. You have saved the capital. Thank you."
5874,Skinny Central Country child,...........
5875,Figaro,<< Possideo >>
5876,Rutile,"The stone is coming out......! Jude, you can do it......!"
5877,Skinny Central Country child,......Nn......
5878,Figaro,"......There, got it."
5879,Rutile,Thank goodness......!
5880,Faust,The moonstone is in a terrible state.
5881,Figaro,"It doesn't look any different, but yes. If it falls into the hands of humans who know no better, they'll suffer misfortune after misfortune - people will surely die. Well, I guess this goes to Murr. It is the moonstone, after all."
5882,Narrator,"The giant bird - so large that it blankets the entire city - spreads its wings, circling above the castle. With every beat of its wings, a warm wind carrying the stench of blood blows through the air. The giant bird attacks the castle tower with its beak. But the snowdome barrier protects the castle."
5883,Akira,Amazing......!
5884,Oz,"No...... At this rate, the barrier will reach its limit."
5885,Oz is right,cracks flare up over the barrier every time the bird throws its beak against it. Uneasy murmurs rise up from the crowd. At that moment......
5886,Arthur,<< Pernoctant Nixzo >>!
5887,Narrator,"Arthur sits astride his broom in the sky with his grimoire open, and chants his spell. Light gathers around his grimoire, and turns into little glowing orbs. They fly at the giant bird, speeding like shooting stars. Arthur tears through the night sky, keeping pace with the orbs of light."
5888,Narrator,(Cawing)
5889,Narrator,"The orbs strike the giant bird, and it lets out a terrifying screech of pure rage. It flaps its wings, and chases after Arthur who flies ahead of it."
5890,Arthur,That's right! Come this way!
5891,Narrator,"I nervously chase Arthur's movements with my eyes. I glance at Oz, who is standing by my side. -Oz is asleep."
5892,Akira,O-Oz......
5893,Oz,......Sorry.
5894,Narrator,"Oz opens his eyes, and bitterly looks at his own hands. He must've fallen asleep trying to use his magic."
5895,Oz,Sage.
5896,Akira,Yes......
5897,Oz,"When we saved Faust from the brink of death, you transferred magic to me. Can you do that again now?"
5898,Akira,Transfer magic to you......?
5899,Oz,"A sage is one who guides wizards. Theoretically, you should be able to grant me power and draw my power out from me."
5900,Akira,......I will try.
5901,Narrator,"Like I did that day, I place my hand in Oz's palm."
5902,Akira,Is it working......?
5903,Narrator,"After a long silence, Oz shakes his head."
5904,Oz,......Nothing is coming across......
5905,Akira,I'm sorry......
5906,Oz,No......
5907,Narrator,"At that moment, we hear lively voices from the sky. Wizards are gathering on their brooms."
5908,Arthur,......! You guys......!
5909,Shylock,We're here to help.
5910,Murr,It's the Umbra Volans! It's huge!
5911,Rustica,I don't think it'll fit in my birdcage.
5912,Chloe,C-can we really beat it?
5913,Arthur,Let's work together! Thank you!
5914,Narrator,"The Western wizards have arrived. They circle the sky above the capital, taking their positions around the giant bird like a magic circle."
5915,Narrator,(Screech)
5916,Narrator,"From the center, Arthur raises his voice."
5917,Arthur,Let's go!
5918,Arthur,Let's go!
5919,Murr,Yeah!
5920,Shylock,I'm ready whenever you are.
5921,Narrator,Arthur lifts his grimoire high into the sky. Blue lightning flashes across the night.
5922,Arthur,<< Pernoctant Nixzo >>!
5923,Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
5924,Shylock,<< Invibelle >>
5925,Rustica,<< Amorest Viesse >>
5926,Chloe,<< Suispicibo Voitengok >>!
5927,Narrator,"The lights that they release rush towards the bird with a tremendous ferocity. They gather into a single beam, which pierces its giant body."
5928,Chloe,Yes......!
5929,Narrator,"The giant bird lets out a cacophonous screech, writhing in pain and wildly flapping its wings. It opens its bright red beak and attacks Arthur."
5930,Arthur,...........!
5931,Rustica,Watch out......!
5932,Narrator,(Crash)
5933,Arthur,Aaagh......!
5934,Murr,Arthur!
5935,Arthur,......I'm all right!
5936,Narrator,"Part of the bird's wing strikes Arthur, and smoke rises from his shoulder. No matter how many times the Western wizards attack the bird, it pays them no attention. It persistently chases and attacks only Arthur."
5937,Arthur,............
5938,Oz,Arthur......
5939,Narrator,"Oz grips the edges of the balcony, leaning over it."
5940,Akira,Why is it attacking only Arthur......?
5941,Oz,"Because he's the prince of Central Country. The Umbra Volans is attached to him, for it too was born on Central ground."
5942,Narrator,"Frustrated, Oz clenches his hands into fists. Gradually, he turns to gaze towards the moon hanging in the sky, staring at it intensely. He glares at the glowing moon peeking through the expanse of large black wings, and mutters."
5943,Oz,......I won't let you have your way. Sage.
5944,Akira,Yes......
5945,Oz,I'm sorry - but you are going to share my fate.
5946,Akira,Huh......? Woah......!
5947,Narrator,"Oz takes my shoulder, and we lean over from the balcony."
5948,Akira,Hey...... Wai-!
5949,Oz,Let's go.
5950,Akira,...........!
5951,Narrator,"Oz leaps from the castle balcony, holding me in his arms."
5952,Narrator,"Dark wings, and a golden moon. We plummet swiftly."
5953,Akira,............
5954,Oz,"Grant me strength, Sage. You are the one who guides us. Believe in me. I believe in you. Akira."
5955,Narrator,"I tightly grip Oz's hand in return. For I, too, once wished for the same. I want to build a small bridge of trust. With this world. With the people living in this world. And...... With myself. Oz slowly releases his fingers. In that hand, he holds a magnificent staff. I hadn't noticed, but the speed at which we're falling has slowed. I look at Oz. He opens his mouth."
5956,Oz,<< Vox Nox >>
5957,Narrator,In that moment...... We defy the laws of nature. And rush upwards into the night sky. As if we're flying to the moon.
5958,Nova,You'll be returning the moonstone.
5959,Mithra,Rutile won't be coming back. Now it's easier for me to fight.
5960,Nova,You think you stand a chance against me?
5961,Mithra,Yes. For I am not alone.
5962,Bradley,All right. Guess I'm already on board.
5963,Nero,Geez. I thought I was comfortably retired......
5964,Owen,Want me to help?
5965,Bradley,Owen......
5966,Owen,"If you beg me, I'll help you out."
5967,Mithra,Let's have some tea at the Central marketplace. I'll treat you to cake.
5968,Owen,Yay. Who's this guy?
5969,Mithra,Nova.
5970,Owen,So this guy is Nova......
5971,Nova,........
5972,Bradley,Well then. Let's get this started. << Adnopotensum >>!
5973,Nova,........
5974,Nero,<< Adnodus Omnis >>!
5975,Nova,Hmph. No matter how many of you there are....
5976,Owen,<< Cure Memini >>
5977,Nova,............!
5978,Owen,You can't move anymore. And now...... << Cuare Morito >>
5979,Nova,............!
5980,Owen,"I'll show you what's inside my trunk. He's furious at me for capturing him, so he's really savage. Inside this bag lies - hell. Cerberus, the watchdog of hell, will leap out."
5981,Narrator,(Growling)
5982,Nova,............!
5983,Owen,"Huh, you managed to dodge his attack. But are you sure that's where you want to run?"
5984,Nova,What?
5985,Mithra,<< Arthim >>
5986,Nova,............! I'm falling......!
5987,Mithra,"Welcome. I opened this door through space just for you - right into the magma reservoir of a blazing volcano. Please dissolve there, bones and all."
5988,Nova,Hmph...... We'll meet again. For I am......
5989,Mithra,<< Arthim >>
5990,Narrator,(Door closes)
5991,Bradley,............
5992,Nero,............
5993,Owen,............
5994,Mithra,Sigh...... I'm tired......
5995,Bradley,Hey......! You really should've listened to the end there!?
5996,Mithra,Why?
5997,Bradley,Because it sounded like he was about to tell us his identity and stuff!
5998,Mithra,But I didn't want him to show up again......
5999,Bradley,"Even so......! God, you really are an idiot......"
6000,Mithra,"Sigh...... It's fine. He was pretty badly injured, so he probably won't appear again for a while."
6001,Narrator,(Growling)
6002,Owen,Oh. I need to close my bag.
6003,Nero,......! Look at that! The clouds above the castle - lightning is striking in reverse towards the sky......!
6004,Mithra,Oh......
6005,Owen,Oh......
6006,Bradley,Oh......
6007,Nero,What's with the strange reaction......?
6008,Mithra,I've suffered through that more than enough times......
6009,Nero,What?
6010,Mithra,That lightning is Oz.
6011,Oz,<< Vox Nox >>
6012,Akira,............!
6013,Narrator,(Thunder)
6014,Narrator,(Cawing)
6015,Narrator,"Oz descends upon the night sky, cradling me with one arm. Every time he calmly raises his staff, tremendous claps of thunder reverberate across the skies. Bluish-white lights spread out like veins as far as I can see."
6016,Arthur,Sir Oz......!
6017,Shylock,So you can use magic now.
6018,Rustica,It's even more powerful than the rumors say......
6019,Chloe,"So this is Oz, the most powerful wizard in the world......"
6020,Murr,Ah......! The Umbra Volans is fleeing this way!
6021,Narrator,"Weakened by Oz's lightning, the giant bird flies unsteadily in the direction of Arthur and the rest of the wizards. The bird soars haphazardly through the sky at a ferocious speed, its bright red beak open."
6022,Akira,Oz!
6023,Narrator,"Oz adjusts his grip on his staff like he's locking down his aim. He sharply narrows his eyes, fixing his gaze on the bird maniacally tearing through the dark night. Breaking out into a slight grin, he looks ready for a fight."
6024,Oz,Don't think you can get away from me. I'll turn you into a skewer. << Vox Nox >>
6025,Narrator,Oz raises his staff high.
6026,Narrator,(Rumbling)
6027,Narrator,"The ground starts shaking tremendously. In the flash of an eye, the collapsed Central tower rises up beneath the giant bird."
6028,Narrator,It happens at such a dizzying speed that the bird is left with no escape.
6029,Central Country man,The tower...... Our tower was rebuilt in an instant......!
6030,Central Country man,Is this a dream......!?
6031,Central Country woman,Ah......! The bird......!
6032,Narrator,(Cawing)
6033,Narrator,"The giant bird lets out a piercing screech, thrashing its wings. The reconstructed Central tower rushes up to stab the bird through its pure black head."
6034,Central Country woman,Yes.....!
6035,Central Country man,He took down the monstrous bird......!
6036,Central Country man,The wizard defeated it......!
6037,Narrator,"The giant bird flaps its wings twice, thrice, and then limply collapses. Its body crumbles into countless black feathers."
6038,Narrator,Which fall upon the city like rain. Amidst the light of the sunrise.
6039,Shino,......Feathers are falling from the sky......
6040,Cain,Looks like it's all over......
6041,Heathcliff,Nn...... Huh......? Why am I wearing Cain's jacket......?
6042,Cain,"Ah, umm......"
6043,Heathcliff,Huh!? Why am I naked!?
6044,Shino,I'll tell you later.
6045,Heathcliff,"Shino, you're injured."
6046,Shino,Don't worry about it. ......But let me say this first.
6047,Heathcliff,............
6048,Shino,"I'm so glad you're safe, Heath."
6049,Bradley,"Ew, gross. What's with these feathers......"
6050,Owen,The whole town is pitch black. This is fun.
6051,Nero,"Hey, this looks like trouble......"
6052,Mithra,Maybe it is......
6053,Nero,"The sky is filled with morning light, but the ground is as pitch-black as night..... What an inside-out and careless sight - just like wizards."
6054,Bradley,What's with the sudden poetry......?
6055,Nero,"Shut up, Brad. Shut your mouth."
6056,Rutile,All these black feathers......
6057,Figaro,They won't do any good; we should purify them.
6058,Mitile,But...... There's so many feathers. Can we really purify them all?
6059,Faust,It'll be fine. There are twenty-one wizards. Everyone just needs to work together.
6060,Mitile,............
6061,Faust,Did I say something strange?
6062,Mitile,"Eastern wizards like being alone, but you said everyone......"
6063,Faust,"......It really will be faster. Southern wizards specialize in working together, right? Lead us by example."
6064,Mitile,Yes!
6065,Riquet,"Let's work hard! If we all work together, we'll be done in no time."
6066,Lennox,You're right.
6067,Jude,......Nn...... Huh......?
6068,Lennox,"Ah, are you awake?"
6069,Jude,The city is pitch black...... Am I still dreaming?
6070,Figaro,Don't worry. It'll turn pure white soon enough.
6071,Rustica,<< Amorest Viesse >>
6072,Central Country man,Woah...... The black feathers are glowing white and disappearing......
6073,Central Country woman,"Thank you, mister wizard!"
6074,Central Country man,Thank you!
6075,Chloe,"Ahaha, they're all waving to us! This reminds me of the parade! The tower has been repaired, and everyone looks so happy!"
6076,Shylock,You're right. Humans really are self-serving. But that must be what's endearing about them. ......Oh?
6077,Chloe,What? Did you find something? A shard of purple sapphire...... Is this a piece of Murr's soul? I didn't realize there was one by the Central tower. I'm sure Murr will be delighted when we hand it to him. Shylo-....
6078,Shylock,Gulp.
6079,Chloe,Shylock!?
6080,Shylock,Shh...... It's a secret.
6081,Chloe,"Um, a secret......"
6082,Murr,"Shylock, I cleaned up my area!"
6083,Shylock,"My, what a good boy you are. Can you handle another round?"
6084,Murr,I can!
6085,Shylock,Then let's go.
6086,Chloe,............ I witnessed something I shouldn't have......
6087,Cock Robin,Prince Arthur! I'm so glad you're all right!
6088,Drummond,Squeak! Squeak squeak!
6089,Arthur,That goes for you two as well - thank you for protecting the people. Ah...... Let me turn you back. << Pernoctant Nixzo >>
6090,Drummond,"......Squee, squeak.... Prince Arthur......! How could you act so recklessly......!"
6091,Arthur,"I apologize for making you worry. But I had the support of reliable comrades. That's right...... Let me introduce him once more. Sir Oz, Sir Oz!"
6092,Oz,Arthur......
6093,Arthur,Please come over here.
6094,Oz,............
6095,Arthur,"Let me introduce him to everyone here. He is the man who raised me, and my master of magic: Sir Oz."
6096,Oz,......I am Oz. Thank you for watching over Arthur.
6097,Drummond,......Y-Yes......
6098,Oz,"Arthur is....... He's naughty, reckless, and brimming with curiosity, so it must have been difficult to take care of him."
6099,Drummond,"I-indeed, it's exactly as you say......! I thought my heart was going to stop yesterday!"
6100,Oz,"I understand how you feel. When he was little, he stumbled across the fort of the Ice Witch while chasing a rabbit, and......"
6101,Arthur,"Sir Oz, please don't tell him about my past! It's embarrassing!"
6102,Cock Robin,Ahaha! How strange...... This is just like a parent-teacher meeting!
6103,Snow,"My, goodness. I'm glad everything worked out in the end."
6104,White,"Sage, that was quite the undertaking."
6105,Akira,"Yes. But I'm glad everyone is safe. And I'm now hopeful that the misunderstandings about wizards will be resolved, little by little......"
6106,Snow,You're right. Everyone worked so hard.
6107,White,Oh? Is that the king's younger brother......?
6108,Vincent,Sir Sage.
6109,Akira,Mister Vincent......
6110,Vincent,"The Sage's wizards saved us this time. I don't intend to thank you, but I would like to proceed with the inauguration ceremony that we had previously cancelled."
6111,Snow,What's this all of a sudden?
6112,White,I take it that you want us to stay silent about how Nicholas was involved in all this?
6113,Snow,"It was a huge mistake on your part, after all."
6114,White,I wouldn't be surprised if the other countries demanded reparations from you.
6115,Vincent,"...... What do you say, Sir Sage?"
6116,Akira,"Of course, we'd be delighted to!"
6117,Central Country woman,Waaah......!
6118,Central Country man,It's the new Sage and his wizards!
6119,Central Country man,Congratulations on the inauguration ceremony!
6120,Central Country woman,Thank you for saving us......!
6121,Narrator,(Cheering)
6122,Arthur,"Thank you! Thank you, everyone!"
6123,Cain,What roaring applause! Even if I can't see everyone - I can still feel the sight before my eyes.
6124,Riquet,I'm so glad everyone is safe and happy.
6125,Oz,I agree.
6126,Snow,Everyone looks like they're having fun.
6127,White,"How wonderful, how wonderful."
6128,Mithra,This is the first time I've worn such formal clothing.
6129,Owen,Me too. Matching clothes are weird and interesting.
6130,Bradley,"Hmph. Well, this doesn't feel bad."
6131,Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
6132,Narrator,(Fireworks)
6133,Central Country woman,Woaah......
6134,Narrator,(Cheering)
6135,Shylock,"Murr, you really do love fireworks."
6136,Murr,I do~!
6137,Rustica,"I'm glad we could all wear your outfits together, Chloe."
6138,Chloe,Yeah! I didn't think the Northern wizards would wear them too!
6139,Shino,Not bad. I feel like I've taken over this castle.
6140,Heathcliff,"Hey, don't make such unsettling comments......"
6141,Nero,"Geez, everyone can see me now...... Guess I have to close my restaurant in the East."
6142,Faust,You should open shop in the magic headquarters. I'll drop by for a meal once in a while.
6143,Mitile,Nii-sama! Everyone is smiling and waving at us!
6144,Rutile,Yes. It makes me happy to see everyone smiling.
6145,Lennox,"Yes, truly."
6146,Figaro,"We all worked hard - that goes for everyone here, and the people in the castle and the capital, too. And you too, Sir Sage."
6147,Narrator,"I smile, nodding at Figaro's words. Everyone is smiling - the wizards standing on the balcony, and the people looking up at them. I hope we can see many more sights like this, as we continue to build these tiny bridges of trust. So that I can find a reason - no matter how small - in coming to this world and meeting these wizards. So that the story written in the sage's manual can end happily ever after."
6148,Narrator,Ending Credits
6149,Special thanks,Dear Sage
6150,Rutile,"......By the way, did we ever figure out what Mister Mithra's bizarre injury is?"
6151,Murr,"You're right, Mithra's the only one we haven't figured out yet. Mine is that lots of me's appear!"
6152,Mithra,"I don't care. More importantly, I'm so sleepy......"
6153,Shino,Then go to sleep.
6154,Mithra,"I can't fall asleep, you see. That's why I haven't slept for days."
6155,Arthur,That sounds horrible...... When was the last time you slept?
6156,Mithra,The last time...... ......... I haven't slept for a while...... Ever since we fought the < Great Catastrophe >?
6157,Arthur,Isn't that your bizarre injury......?
6158,Mithra,......Maybe......
6159,Murr,So dense......
6160,Shino,So dense.......
6161,Rutile,I'll give you some goods that will help you get a good night's sleep.
6162,Akira,There's a strong breeze today....
6163,Narrator,(Woosh)
6164,Akira,"Woah....! ...Something came flying into my face... What is this, a newspaper clipping?"
6165,Chloe,"Ah! Sorry, Sir Sage! Rustica was showing me a newspaper bulletin for a salon that features a portrait of Murr!"
6166,Akira,"Of Murr? Ah, you're right.... He looks like a completely different person here - intelligent and cool...."
6167,Chloe,"This Murr is so cool, right! He's winking with a composed expression and crossing his legs... He looks super smart."
6168,Rustica,"Pardon us, Sir Sage. This bulletin was published by a social salon in Western Country. Murr was a famous man; he was known as the genius of the era."
6169,Akira,Right.... Murr was an incredible scholar before he got too close to the secret of the < Great Catastrophe > and his soul shattered to pieces.
6170,Murr,Did you call~?
6171,Chloe,"Ah, it's the current Murr. What were you doing? Playing with a ball? Chasing a bird?"
6172,Murr,"I was playing with Shino! He was blowing bubbles, and my job was to break them!"
6173,Akira,"(He really is like a playful cat... I can't believe he was a genius of the era. I mean, the Murr in the clipping does look handsome, but....) (The current Murr and the old Murr. I think I prefer....)"
6174,Option,The current Murr.
6175,Akira,"(The current Murr. I feel like I'm playing with a cat, after all...)"
6176,Murr,Meo~w!
6177,Akira,Woah....!
6178,Chloe,"What's wrong, Murr. You're cuddling up to Sir Sage!"
6179,Option,The old Murr.
6180,Akira,"(The old Murr. He's the first person I met when I came to this world, after all....)"
6181,Murr,I thought so!
6182,Akira,....!
6183,Rustica,"What's this out of nowhere, Murr?"
6184,Murr,Nothi~ng.
6185,Akira,"Murr. May I ask you some questions? I'd like to interview you. I want to leave notes in the Sage's manual, so that even if I have to go back to my world all of a sudden, everyone here will have an easier time getting along with the new sage...."
6186,Murr,Sure! But can I interview you first? What's that newspaper clipping?
6187,Akira,"It's a bulletin featuring the old you, Murr. ...That's right. How do you feel looking at your old self, Murr?"
6188,Murr,He looks cool!
6189,Chloe,He sure is.
6190,Akira,"Okay, so that's the appropriate response.... I'm glad I wasn't just being shallow."
6191,Rustica,"You seem to like that clipping, so I'll give it to you, Sir Sage."
6192,Murr,"Okay then, Sir Sage. Come to my room for the interview. I'll show you all sorts of things!"
6193,Akira,"Thank you. I'll pay a visit, then."
6194,Akira,"So this is your room, Murr..."
6195,Option,Do you sleep in a hammock?
6196,Murr,Most of the time! I love swaying back and forth! I also like falling asleep on tree branches!
6197,Option,Do you like rocking chairs?
6198,Murr,"I do! You know when someone tells you to sit still, and you look like you're sitting still, but you're not!"
6199,Option,Are you good at darts?
6200,Murr,I am! I love playing with cards and roulettes too! Gambling is exciting!
6201,Murr,What else do you want to look at? A diamond? An iolite? A cat's eye? An opal? A garnet?
6202,Akira,"Woah.... You have so many jewels in your drawer... Murr, you really like sparkling things, don't you?"
6203,Murr,I do~!
6204,Akira,"Um, before we talk about gems, could you tell me about yourself, Murr? Like your full name, or your job...."
6205,Murr,Murr Hart. I guess my job is a brinicle? Being a piece of ice growing downward sounds fun!
6206,Akira,.....?
6207,Murr,"When the ocean freezes, the dense, cold seawater it produces overflows downward, and it instantaneously creates a hollow pillar of ice!"
6208,Akira,"P-please don't pull trivia out of nowhere. That's not your real job, is it, Murr?"
6209,Murr,What's real? Does it bite? Does it have a tail?
6210,Akira,Um....
6211,Murr,Isn't that a wolf? Grrr!
6212,Murr,Isn't that a wolf? Grrr!
6213,Akira,Woah... Ahaha! Don't nibble at me! Um....
6214,Option,Tell me about your family.
6215,Murr,They were rich merchants! They travelled the world! I dug!
6216,Akira,You dug?
6217,Murr,Stones! Because we were jewelers!
6218,Akira,Eh? That means....
6219,Murr,I'm gonna bite you!
6220,Option,What's your favorite food?
6221,Murr,"Fish meuniere! I like it when the flavoring is simple, so it suits white wine! As for the wine, I like it when it's heavy and dry!"
6222,Akira,You sound like a connoisseur.
6223,Murr,I've been told I have a refined palette!
6224,Akira,I see! I thought you would steal fish in your mouth like a cat.....
6225,Murr,Mithra's the only guy who would be so unrefined~! Cooking is science! Because it's the product of a chef's knowledge! But I will bite you raw!
6226,Option,What's your hobby?
6227,Murr,"Gambling! Place a bet with me, Sir Sage!"
6228,Akira,A bet? I'm not confident....
6229,Murr,"Eh~? But I wanna strip you down~! I wanna see your lifeless, pathetic face~!"
6230,Akira,P-please don't say something so terrifying so cheerfully.
6231,Murr,I like gambling because it's exciting! I also like nibbling!
6232,Akira,Aaagh! W-wait....!
6233,Murr,Ahahaha!
6234,Akira,"(At this rate, it looks like I'll have trouble getting a lot of information out of Murr himself....)"
6235,Shylock,"And that's why you came to me? I think that was the right choice, Sir Sage."
6236,Akira,I'm sorry for making you do this... Could you tell me Murr's basic profile?
6237,Shylock,"Murr Hart. His professions are: a jeweler, a philosopher, a professor of mineralogy, an astronomer, a mathematician, an inventor, a renowned scholar...."
6238,Akira,P-please give me a moment. I can't write that fast....
6239,Shylock,"One phrase is enough: ""A lunatic genius."""
6240,Akira,"Wh-what kind of person was the old Murr? I have a bulletin from a salon with a portrait of the old Murr, but...."
6241,Shylock,"My, he looks so composed... Fufu, this brings back memories. This was the expression he made whenever he messed up."
6242,Akira,"Really? He's winking all handsomely, though."
6243,Shylock,"He's looking at you with one eye instead of two... What he's trying to say is ""let me get away with it."" This article is from an academic meeting - he must've done something to infuriate all the gathered scholars. Murr was always making people furious. He was an insensitive and arrogant bundle of intellectual curiosity-and a heartless person to boot, after all."
6244,Shylock,"He really was a loathsome person. I often insulted him, calling him ""loathsome Murr."""
6245,Akira,"(Shylock... He's roasting Murr, but he looks like he's having fun....) I can't believe Murr was that kind of person, knowing what he's like now. He loves to pull pranks, but he's kind and adorable, like a cat."
6246,Shylock,"It makes me happy to hear that. I essentially raised the current Murr, after all. When Murr's soul first shattered, he was basically a beast; he couldn't even speak human words. I patiently taught him words and common sense, and finally, he became capable of conversation. Isn't he such a cute, good boy?"
6247,Akira,"Yes. His sudden actions often surprise me, but Murr always makes me feel happy."
6248,Shylock,I'm glad to hear it.
6249,Akira,"I want to know what Murr wants to do, and what he doesn't want to do... Basically, his desires, but how do you think I should go about asking him? Should we ask the current Murr, or should we try to guess what the old Murr would've wanted...."
6250,Shylock,"I know of Murr's past, but not of his future. I don't intend to tamper with it either. ....I'll give you something nice. It might be of use to you, Sir Sage."
6251,Akira,Something nice?
6252,Shylock,A fragment of Murr's soul that I discovered in Western Country in the distant past.
6253,Akira,"A fragment of Murr's soul that Shylock sealed in a jar using magic.... It's shining like purple sapphire.... If I open the jar, Murr might materialize because of his bizarre injury, and then I could speak to a part of his soul..... ...But I'm kind of scared. The Murr in the newspaper clip was handsome, but it seems like he had lots of personality issues..... ......."
6254,Narrator,"I think it over for a long time, and ultimately reach for the lid of the magic jar. I open it slowly using my strength. An arrogant, heartless, insensitive genius. I'm scared, but I want to meet him. The ""loathsome Murr"" Shylock speaks of."
6255,Narrator,(Click)
6256,Akira,...Woah....!
6257,Narrator,"I open the jar. The purple sapphire fragment shines and dyes the moonlit night a blue color. A human shadow appears amidst the strange, beautiful light. An elegant and bold demeanor. I hold my breath, overwhelmed by the sight of his sexy, sharp, intellectual eyes. The materialized soul shard narrows his cat-like eyes, then proceeds to remove his hat and bow like a gentleman."
6258,Murr,"Good evening, Sir Sage. My name is Murr Hart. I was born in Western Country, and I am currently your wizard. Does this suffice as a greeting? Is this the brief introduction Sir Sage desires?"
6259,Narrator,I open my mouth nervously.
6260,Akira,You knew that I wanted to speak to you....?
6261,Murr,"I was listening to your conversation with Shylock from within the jar, after all. He's a good friend of mine, but don't you think he's a bit too possessive, trapping me inside a jar like that?"
6262,Narrator,Murr laughs and begins to walk away from me. I snap out of my daze and chase after him.
6263,Akira,Wh-where are you going?
6264,Murr,"I can't go anywhere. Because I am merely a fragment of Murr's soul, tucked away in your hands. You must at least let me moonbathe. Ah... my dearest beauty. I've longed to meet you all this time."
6265,Narrator,"Murr stops and gazes up at the moon. As if performing a vow of love, he puts his lips to his fingertips and reaches for the moon. Bathed in the blue moonlight, he looks more powerful and fortunate than anyone else in this world."
6266,Akira,Um... May I ask you a question?
6267,Murr,"Go on. But first, let me beg for your forgiveness. Even if I do something to infuriate you, please know that it's not because I loathe you. By the by, do you enjoy the night breeze?"
6268,Akira,The night breeze? I don't dislike it....
6269,Murr,Excellent.
6270,Akira,Eh? W-woah....!?
6271,Narrator,"The moment Murr takes my hand, a sudden gust of wind surrounds us, and in the next moment we are floating in the night sky decorated with glittering stars. Murr laughs at how I cling to him immediately; together, we step across the night wind without a broom."
6272,Murr,"Let's make this a walk through the sky. It's perfect for an interview. Light exercise stimulates the brain, after all."
6273,Narrator,Murr draws my hand as we walk across the moonlit sky.
6274,Murr,"Do give me your questions, Sir Sage."
6275,Akira,"Ah... Um, please wait a moment. I need to open my sage's manual.... P-please don't let go of my hand."
6276,Murr,No worries; I won't drop you like a plate. What's this? A newspaper clipping about me?
6277,Akira,Ah... I left it in my pocket.... This is kind of embarrassing....
6278,Murr,Why do you say so?
6279,Akira,Because carrying this around makes it seem like I'm your fan.
6280,Murr,"How interesting. You say you're interested in me, but you're embarrassed to admit your affectionate feelings for me? Or perhaps you have no affectionate feelings for me?"
6281,Akira,I do think... I like you. But I thought you might dislike the kind of affection that is purely based in curiosity.
6282,Murr,But you still want to know?
6283,Akira,"Yes... That's why I'm prepared to be told strange things, and to get hurt."
6284,Narrator,Murr stops moving. The tips of his mouth curve upwards in amusement.
6285,Murr,"Excellent. I respect that sensibility of yours. That's what it means to be an explorer at heart: your interest and curiosity win over your feelings of fear and anxiety. Your intellect defeats your instinct. Go on; take a look. I am the unknown cave you have discovered. Continue your search: discover whether what lies in this cave is treasure, or a demonic dragon."
6286,Narrator,"Murr laughs, as if testing me. I take a deep breath and open the sage's manual. The wizard before my eyes is the embodiment of many charming and dangerous questions. Let me unravel them one by one."
6287,Akira,"What do you like, Murr?"
6288,Murr,Mysteries. Surprises. Gems. Mana stones. Travels. Stars. < The Great Catastrophe >.
6289,Akira,What do you dislike?
6290,Murr,Boredom.
6291,Akira,What are you bad at?
6292,Murr,"Staying still. Sympathize for the poor me trapped in a jar, Sir Sage."
6293,Akira,But you can use magic - why can't you just transport yourself elsewhere?
6294,Murr,"I can't move the soul fragment, you see. And I can't travel very far from the fragment itself."
6295,Akira,"Could you show me your magic tool, Murr?"
6296,Murr,It lies within your hands.
6297,Akira,Huh?
6298,Murr,Look at my fingertips that are joined with yours. The ring there is my magic tool. Isn't it beautiful?
6299,Akira,It is... What is this gemstone called?
6300,Murr,Red beryl. I made it from a rock I cut myself when I was a child traveling the world with my parents.
6301,Narrator,"I take my eyes off the unusual, glittering ring, and notice that Murr is gazing at me. His chilly, brilliant eyes look as if they see right through me."
6302,Akira,...What kind of person are you?
6303,Murr,Now that is a philosophical question. What kind of person do I look like to you? Do I seem rational? Or do I seem emotional?
6304,Akira,I think you're a rational and intelligent person. But....
6305,Murr,But?
6306,Akira,I also kind of think a rational person wouldn't fall in love with the moon....
6307,Murr,Good point. To fall in love so passionately that you lose your soul - that's terribly emotional behavior.
6308,Akira,So which are you?
6309,Murr,"I wonder. I can fall in love through reason; I can yearn for exploration through emotion. Of course, the opposite could happen too. But I simply cannot stop myself. The mysteries of the world, the light of the moon - they make my heart race. I am feverishly driven by the passion of curiosity and affection."
6310,Narrator,"I feel the same way about him. The more I talk to Murr, the more I'm driven by my curiosity and affection towards him."
6311,Option,How do you feel about yourself?
6312,Murr,"I feel the same way you do. I too want to know about myself. Everything in this world exists to satisfy the pursuit of self-knowledge. My intellect, my curiosity, my passion; they all exist to define where my soul truly belongs. You, too, should feel, listen, taste, and touch the world; toy with it, as you search for your true self. Because there is nothing more important in your world than the sensibilities of your soul."
6313,Option,How do you feel about me?
6314,Murr,That's a cute question.
6315,Akira,...S-sorry. I got curious....
6316,Murr,Huh.
6317,Akira,......
6318,Narrator,S-sorry. Pretend you didn't hear that.....
6319,Murr,"Oh, no need to apologize. I was enjoying the silence. See, whenever I fall silent after a delicate question, everyone just apologizes. I like to enjoy that moment."
6320,Akira,(H-he has a terrible personality....)
6321,Murr,"Judging from your reaction, I think you fall into the ""like"" category. It's up to you to search me out and discover how I feel about you."
6322,Murr,"Now, Sir Sage. You also wish to know Murr, right? May I ask for your cooperation?"
6323,Akira,My cooperation?
6324,Murr,"I would like to go to the City of Glory in Central Country. I have business with the seabirds there who love shiny objects. In order to get closer to Murr's identity, could you put me in a jar and take me to the City of Glory?"
6325,Narrator,"The next day, I bring Murr's soul fragment to the City of Glory. The City of Glory is a canal town. It also happens to be where Cain is from. Many ships float down the canals, passing under the bridges. I stand atop a bridge in the City of Glory, just as Murr tells me to."
6326,Akira,Is this spot all right?
6327,Murr,It should be fine. Now place Shylock's magic jar atop the bridge handrail.
6328,Akira,The magic jar?
6329,Murr,Yes. Hurry; the sun will set soon.
6330,Narrator,I don't understand why the sunset is relevant. I place the jar on the handrail as I'm told. An approaching ship blows its whistle. Murr narrows his cat-like eyes and gazes at me with an exceptionally kind smile.
6331,Murr,I'd like you to do me a favor. Please write the following in the sage's manual.
6332,Akira,The sage's manual? Give me a moment. I'll pull out a notepad...
6333,Murr,"Murr respects the sage, who is an intelligent explorer. For fascination and curiosity are the key to the evolution of life, the world, and the universe. For fearlessly approaching the subject of investigation - for approaching me - as his heart willed him to... I do not hesitate to shower him in praise or extend a hand of fellowship. That is why Murr truly felt guilty. The sage was infuriated, but he eventually forgave him. For we are both friends who understand the nature of investigation."
6334,Akira,...I was infuriated but I forgave you? What do you mean?
6335,Murr,Duck down.
6336,Akira,Huh?
6337,Narrator,"In that moment, a screeching seabird flies over my head."
6338,Akira,Woah...!
6339,Narrator,"I duck down immediately. The seabird grabs the jar reflecting the light of the sunset, and casts it into the canal."
6340,Akira,Ah...! Oh no....!
6341,Narrator,The color drains from my face as I look into the canal.
6342,Akira,(I can't believe I dropped the soul fragment I borrowed from Shylock into the canal....)
6343,Narrator,"But the jar had not sunk into the canal. It lays on the deck of a ship passing under the bridge - the timing seems just perfect. And next to it stands Murr, who was standing by my side just moments ago. He's winking with a composed expression. That's right - this is the expression that says, ""let me get away with it."""
6344,Akira,Murr...!?
6345,Murr,"I gave you plenty of hints, you know? I hate boredom, and I am bad at staying still. Naturally I couldn't stand being stuck in a jar on a shelf in the magic headquarters. Our nightwalk was terribly fun, Sir Sage. Say hi to Shylock for me. And let us meet again."
6346,Narrator,"I finally realize what has happened. Murr tricked me so smoothly into letting him depart on his distant travels. Driven by Murr's lies, I took the magic jar out of the magic headquarters, and placed him atop a ship headed to who-knows-where."
6347,Akira,Y-you tricked me!?
6348,Murr,"Alternatively, you could see it like this: I helped you build your adventurous spirit. This goodbye exists so that we can enjoy our next meeting."
6349,Narrator,"The ship continues to accelerate, maybe due to Murr's magic."
6350,Narrator,"I am lost for words, but somewhere in my heart, I feel myself enjoying the moment. He fooled me, and I'm frustrated, but I'm also having fun. I feel a bizarre excitement racing up my body because of his power. I think I understand why Shylock insulted him in this way - ""Loathsome Murr."" What a charming, terrible person."
6351,Akira,Geez...! I won't forgive you when I catch you again!
6352,Murr,My dearest Sage - did I not beg for your forgiveness at the very beginning?
6353,Narrator,Murr pulls his hat down and bows like a gentleman. And then - Murr's soul fragment disappears.
6354,Shylock,...I see. So Murr's fragment disappeared.
6355,Murr,Disappeared? Like this?
6356,Narrator,(Woosh)
6357,Murr,Hello! Am I here? Not here? Here?
6358,Shylock,"Murr, please behave."
6359,Narrator,(Woosh)
6360,Murr,Ye~s! I'll do as you say!
6361,Akira,"I'm sorry... I lost it even though you let me borrow it, Shylock."
6362,Shylock,It's all right. I expected this to happen. Plus....
6363,Narrator,Shylock places several magic jars on the countertop and smiles. Purple sapphire shards glimmer within each jar.
6364,Shylock,I still have plenty of soul fragments that I have yet to feed Murr.
6365,Murr,"You're a tough one, Shylock!"
