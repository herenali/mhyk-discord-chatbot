Akira,We've arrived at the Western tower. Today I'd like the Western wizards to head to the Observatory of the Undeveloped Lands.
Chloe,"An observatory! There's a huge telescope you can use to view the stars, right?"
Rustica,"That's what I hear. I've never been either. If I peer through the telescope and find my bride, how will I go to space?"
Shylock,"Murr often spent all his time at the Observatory of the Undeveloped Lands - before his soul shattered, that is. Murr, do you remember the Observatory?"
Murr,"Umm, it makes me sneeze!"
Rustica,I see.
Chloe,"No, I don't think you do. He probably doesn't remember."
Akira,But why did Murr spend all his time at the Observatory..... ....Ah!
Option,Because he loves the < Great Catastrophe >?
Murr,I love it~! I wonder if we can meet tonight~?
Option,Because he's an astronomer?
Murr,Astronomer? Me when I was an astronomer? Is that something you haven't eaten yet?
Option,Because the telescope is shiny?
Murr,"I love shiny things! But the only shiny part of the telescope is the lens. The moon that you see through the telescope shines more brightly than anything else in the universe, though!"
Shylock,"Well, I guess we should head off."
Akira,Yes! I'm counting on you all.
Murr,"Oh, that's right, Sir Sage. Apparently you get inspired when you gaze at the stars from the Observatory."
Akira,Inspired?
Murr,"That's right! Like, ping! Inspiration! You're gazing into the abyss of the universe, after all. It's only natural that you might discover a new side of yourself. You should try it out too, Sir Sage. After we solve this case, of course!"
Akira,Inspiration - I see. I'll try it out when I feel like discovering a new side of myself.
Akira,So this is the Observatory....
Chloe,There really isn't much around here. I bet you can see the stars really clearly from a place this empty.
Rustica,It's way off from the city lights too. The stars look like they're about to fall out of the sky - you don't even need to look through a telescope.
Akira,It really is beautiful....
Murr,"Telescope, telescope!"
Shylock,"Oh? Do you remember now, Murr?"
Murr,This is where you can get a clear look at the < Great Catastrophe >!
Chloe,Ah! Someone left the observatory!
Astronomer,"Oh, Sir Sage.... Ugh...! My hip....!"
Rustica,"Are you all right, good sir?"
Astronomer,"Ouchh.... I spend all my time gazing through a telescope, so I've ruined my hip...."
Akira,Please don't push yourself. Are you the astronomer who requested our help?
Astronomer,"Indeed..... There have been a series of bizarre incidents ever since the < Great Catastrophe > got so close..... I was hoping the great astronomer, Sir Murr - who I heard had been chosen as a Sage's wizard - would come along....."
Murr,You have business with me?
Astronomer,Oh! So you are Sir Murr...! You look exactly the same as the portrait....!
Murr,What does he look like? Like this? Grrr!
Chloe,As expected of the great genius Murr! You're so famous!
Astronomer,"Please, come this way.... I'll explain what I'd like you to do."
Chloe,Woah....! So this is what the observatory looks like from the inside!
Murr,Let's look at the moon! It looks really close when you gaze at it through the telescope!
Rustica,All these papers on the floor are covered in numbers. Why do you need numbers to gaze at the stars?
Chloe,"Rustica, you look at a page of tadpoles swimming along lines when you play the harpsichord."
Rustica,"Oh, I see. How profound."
Akira,"Ah... This portrait.... What a refined, intellectual elderly lady....."
Shylock,That would be Patia. She was the first head astronomer of this observatory. Though she passed away several hundreds of years ago.
Astronomer,"Exactly.... Patia was one of very few female astronomers at the time, and I am her descendant."
Akira,I see.
Astronomer,"Indeed. This observatory was established by Patia and Sir Murr. Patia went through a lot of trouble, you see.... Society was not kind to female scholars at the time, but Sir Murr came to her defense."
Chloe,"That's so cool of you, Murr!"
Rustica,A true gentleman.
Astronomer,I hear that the two of them were wonderful friends.
Shylock,Friends......
Akira,"What's wrong, Shylock?"
Shylock,"Oh, it's nothing. Could you tell us about the job?"
Astronomer,"Well, it's about the astronomical telescope over there....."
Murr,Huh!? I can't see!?
Akira,Murr. You were already looking through the telescope?
Chloe,"You mean you can't see the stars? Huh, let me take a look...."
Narrator,"Woah....! The stars are so beautiful! So you can see the stars, Murr!"
Murr,I can't see the < Great Catastrophe >! It's the only thing that's missing!
Chloe,"Eh!? ....Ah, you're right....! This astronomical telescope - you can see everything except the < Great Catastrophe >!"
Akira,Wh-why!?
Chloe,"Did you figure out why the telescope isn't working? I checked outside, but you can see the < Great Catastrophe > in the sky."
Shylock,I see. Murr is pouring all his attention into it right now.
Akira,"Any luck, Murr? How's it going?"
Murr,...........
Akira,What's that book? What does it say?
Murr,...........
Akira,"You should take a break. Let me pour you some tea. Come on, Murr......"
Murr,...........
Shylock,"He can't hear you. When he gets focused like this, he completely shuts out his surroundings."
Akira,I-I see.
Shylock,Let's leave the telescope to Murr and take a walk outside.
Chloe,I wonder why we can't see the < Great Catastrophe >?
Shylock,I know why.
Rustica,"I think I've figured it out as well. I noticed a certain feeling in the air, directed at Murr and the astronomical telescope. It wasn't malicious, but....."
Akira,What do you mean?
Shylock,"Do you recall the elderly lady in the portrait? She is probably the cause.... The first head astronomer, Patia. The feelings she left behind must have materialized due to the influence of the < Great Catastrophe >, causing these strange incidents to occur."
Chloe,"The feelings that Patia left behind.... Oh, right, Shylock. Weren't you trying to say something back there?"
Shylock,"Well, it's all in the past, so I suppose I can tell you all.... Patia was probably in love with Murr."
Akira,In love!?
Chloe,Oh no! Now I'm all excited!
Rustica,And? And? Can you give us the details?
Shylock,"You all love gossip, don't you. It's true that the two of them were friends, but.... One day, Patia asked Murr this: ""Are you in love with anybody?"""
Chloe,Ohhh! So she asked! And? What did Murr say in response?
Shylock,"I hear he answered yes. Patia fell silent for a while, and then went on...."
Patia,I see. So you are in love with somebody.....
Murr,Indeed.
Patia,"Murr. If that person rejects you, or leaves you, will you...."
Murr,They will neither reject me nor leave me. For I am in love with the moon.
Patia,The moon? You mean the < Great Catastrophe >?
Murr,Yes. I created this observatory in order to gaze at the moon.
Patia,"I understand that you're a wizard, Murr, but being in love with the moon is...."
Murr,"I may be an astronomer, but I am also a philosopher. Do you really want to debate the concept of love with a philosopher, Patia? All right, then. Here's a question for you. Is it not love if it's not mutual?"
Patia,...I think it's still love.
Murr,Is it not love if it's not accompanied by sexual reproduction?
Patia,...I think it's still love.
Murr,"See? I've just proven that you can fall in love with the moon. I've been yearning for that beautiful moon for all these years. I want to gaze at it, always - even if I can never touch it; even if it will never be mine."
Patia,I see.....
Murr,And? What were you trying to say?
Patia,"....It's nothing. I forget what we were talking about. Murr, you should really stop cutting people off when they're talking. That's a bad habit of yours."
Akira,Miss Patia....
Shylock,"Murr was delighted that he had convinced an astronomer that one could be in love with the moon, but he never caught on to her true feelings."
Chloe,Oh no.... That's heartbreaking.....
Rustica,"So for Madam Patia, this was a hopeless love....."
Shylock,"Well, falling in love with such an unhinged man would only utterly destroy you, so I think this was all for the best."
Chloe,I wonder if Murr will realize...? I want Murr to solve this problem - for Miss Patia's sake as well.
Rustica,He might not remember anything. He looked like he was furiously calculating something earlier.....
Shylock,Let's leave him alone for a while. I think that lunatic ought to learn his lesson: that there are some problems that can't be solved with mathematical equations.
Akira,....Murr.....
Akira,"Murr, how is it going? Do you think you can solve the mystery behind the broken telescope? Everyone else has fallen asleep."
Murr,....Hmmm......
Akira,"Um, you might be overthinking it? Maybe you're missing something really obvious."
Murr,I know the answer. The equation is the difficult part.
Akira,The equation....?
Murr,The path to the answer! Because Patia also understands. You're no longer here. You became a star and now lie beyond my reach - just like the moon.
Akira,Ah.... The telescope lit up....!
Murr,We're both asking for the moon here.
Patia,"....It's nothing. I forget what we were talking about. Murr, you should really stop cutting people off when they're talking. That's a bad habit of yours."
Murr,"And humans die too soon. That's a bad habit of theirs. You will have a happy marriage, and give birth to a child. And eventually, you will die. I'm not the moon, so I'll reject you and leave this place behind. Though I will drop by to gaze at the moon every once in a while. Would you like to have your heart properly broken so you can move on without regrets? Shall I hear out your words of confession?"
Patia,"You're a brilliant man and a great friend, but you truly have the worst personality......."
Murr,You're a strange one too - falling in love with me when the richest man in town wants to marry you. I guess that's just what scholars are like?
Patia,"Murr. If you could no longer see the moon, would you gaze at me instead?"
Murr,"If you haven't turned into a star by then, I'll consider it."
Akira,The light that was surrounding the telescope is growing dimmer......
Murr,"Ah.... I can see it..... I can see the < Great Catastrophe >! Sir Sage, look!"
Akira,"You're right....! That's wonderful, Murr!"
Murr,"I can finally see it again! ....Ah, it's so beautiful..... My beloved < Great Catastrophe >."
Akira,Murr.....
Murr,"Thank you, Patia. It's because of you that I got to see such a beautiful moon. You must be up in the sky as well. You're very beautiful! Cheers for the moon and the stars! << Eanul Rambul >> !"
Rustica,Yawn.... Good morning. Looks like the problem was solved by the time we woke up.
Shylock,"And we don't know how he reached the answer..... Well, that does sound just like Murr."
Akira,I agree. And now we can see the moon from the telescope.
Chloe,The observatory was fun! I'm glad you got to see the < Great Catastrophe > from the astronomical telescope.
Murr,Yeah! Both the moon and the stars were beautiful! I love shiny things!
