Narrator,(Breeze) (Meow)
Akira,"It’s so windy tonight.... Maybe that’s why all the cats won’t stop meowing. I managed to buy some canned cat food for cheap, so I should drop by the old cat lady’s house on the way back. Kuro and Hanako get tuna; Tama gets some chicken, and Tora gets salmon. And senior food for Grandpa Tails. The old cat lady lets me take care of them every now and then because we live close by. Each cat is so cute and unique. Oh, that’s right. The old cat lady mentioned something like this.... Mysterious things happen on nights when the wind is strong, the cats are on edge, and the full moon shines bright in the sky."
Narrator,(Footsteps)
Akira,"Woah.... What a huge full moon.... It looks even brighter than usual. It’s so big and bright, I can probably get a nice picture just with my phone camera. Focus and.... Got it."
Narrator,(Snap)
Narrator,"Once I get a picture of the moon, I head to my apartment’s elevator while gazing at my phone. I press the elevator button, wait for it to arrive, and step through the open doors."
Narrator,(Elevator doors closing)
Akira,Oh. I got a really clear picture of the moon. I’ll show it to the old cat lady when I drop by with the canned cat food. ....Huh? Something seems off.
Narrator,"I look up from my smartphone, and my eyes widen in surprise. This doesn’t look like the elevator in my apartment complex."
Narrator,(Elevator sounds)
Narrator,"Thump, clatter. The echoing sounds are also unfamiliar."
Akira,What’s going on...? Was the building undergoing renovations....?
???,Hello.
Akira,....!?
Narrator,I can’t believe my eyes. A hat floats in mid-air — and it’s speaking to me.
???,"Welcome, Sir Sage. Let me escort you to this elevator’s destination. I am Murr, a Western wizard. Our destination is a world splintered by the < Great Catastrophe >."
Murr,"It’s an honor to meet you, my beloved Sir Sage."
Akira,Woah....!?
Narrator,"A gracious gentleman appears underneath the hat. He pays no attention to my exclamation of surprise, and continues speaking."
Murr,"I may soon drag you into a rather cumbersome situation, Sir Sage. Now, there are many cumbersome things in this world. Take, for example, love affairs, prestige, war, family, friends, revenge, repayment.... But this time, the most cumbersome problem of all awaits us! Saving the world — we would like to ask you for your assistance in this matter."
Akira,.....Wh.... What’s going on.... Am I dreaming.....?
Narrator,The young man named Murr smiles in response to my bewilderment.
Murr,"We’ll be arriving soon. Both the world and I have been torn apart quite terribly, and... You will probably be sorely disappointed in me. But if we could become friends nonetheless — I would be very happy. Oh, brilliant Sage. I have yearned to meet you for so, so long. Truth be told, I don’t care about the world at all. Acts of charity are a pain, after all. But..... I want you to discover the truth about this world."
Akira,Ah......
Narrator,"When Murr disappears, the elevator stops."
Narrator,(Ding)
Narrator,"Slowly, the doors open....."
Man with a fancy beard,Sir Sage....!
Akira,Huh.....
Man with a fancy beard,The Sage has arrived! The wizards’ summoning ritual was a success!
Soldier,Cheers for the Sage!
Soldier,Cheers!
Akira,Huh!? What’s going on!?
Man with a fancy beard,"Now, now, this way, Sir Sage. Thank you for coming to us. My name is Drummond. I am Central Country’s Minister of Magical Affairs."
Meek-looking man,"Erm, I’m Cock Robin, the secretary of Central Country."
Drummond,"This way, Sir Sage! Let me escort you to the Central castle before those pesky wizards arrive!"
Akira,"Huh!? Um, please wait a second. What are you all doing? Is this a prank? Or some new kind of VR experience?"
Drummond,"We were waiting for you, Sir Sage! You are going to battle the < Great Catastrophe > and save the world."
Akira,"Battle what and save the world!? Is my apartment complex doing some kind of game collaboration? Maybe there’s a camera hiding somewhere..... I really can’t have this, you know......"
Drummond,Do not fear! There’s nothing dangerous about this. The pesky wizards are the ones who will be fighting!
Akira,Wizards?
Drummond,"Yes. But they’re a rowdy bunch who never listen to our commands — much like cats. For some reason, they historically only listen to the sage who arrives from another world."
Narrator,(Footsteps)
Soldier,Sir Drummond! We have news....
Drummond,"What!? The wizards!? This is bad. We need to coax the Sage away before they arri..... Ahem! We really need to get close to Sir Sage! Sir Sage, let us hurry to the Central castle!"
Akira,Please wait! I don’t understand anything at all!
Narrator,Surrounded by soldiers — feeling threatened — I shake my head furiously.
Akira,"I really don’t play RPGs, so I don’t know how you want me to react! Please take someone else....."
Drummond,You’ll come with us even if we have to make you. Soldiers!
Akira,........!
Narrator,"The moment I try to flee, the soldiers all draw their swords."
Cock Robin,"Sir Drummond, this is excessive......"
Drummond,Silence! The damn wizards are the ones at fault here!
Narrator,"The silver swords approach me with a terrifying glare. The blades shine as if they’re real, and I turn pale."
Akira,(Oh god! There’s something wrong with these people!)
Narrator,"In that moment, I spot a shadow approaching us from the sky beyond the window. Two young men, flying through the sky on their broomsticks."
Akira,(They’re flying through the sky....!?) (Wh.... What in the world? Is the outside scenery part of this VR too....?)
Narrator,"I strain my eyes, trying to unveil the trick behind this bizarre sight, when..... They pass through the window and land right in front of my eyes. Whisking up a real breeze."
Akira,(Huh....?)
Narrator,"They make their brooms vanish in an instant like magic, and stand on either side of me."
???,"Your prediction was spot-on, Heath. I didn’t think the guys from the Ministry of Magical Affairs would actually come to kidnap the Sage."
???,I told you. ....Humans just don’t trust us.
Narrator,"Surprised, I look at them, one at a time. The tall, fearless young man turns around to look at me. His eyes are of different colors."
???,Are you the new Sage?
Akira,Huh.....?
???,"I’m Cain, a Central wizard. I’m also the knight who will protect you. What’s your name?"
Akira,Ah.... I’m Akira......
Narrator,"When I answer, the young man named Cain turns the corners of his lips upward into a smile."
Cain,"Sir Akira. Nice to meet you. Before we do anything else, let’s deal with these guys."
Narrator,"He laughs boldly and draws his sword. It looks far more splendid than the swords of the other soldiers surrounding us, with fine decorations and a sharpened blade."
Akira,(I... Is this sword real....?)
Narrator,"As a chill of nervousness runs through my body, the soldiers look just as nervous."
Soldier,G-General Cain.....
Soldier,It’s General Cain....!
Drummond,"Arrgh, it’s former General Cain! He’s no longer your commanding officer! Cain! You will be punished for treason if you keep pointing your sword at me, a minister!"
Cain,"I don’t like threatening the elderly, you know? But if you’re going to do anything funny to our dear Sage, that’s another story. Sorry, but I’m not holding back."
Soldier,.......gh.
Cain,"Hey now, don’t flinch. Didn’t I teach you not to get overwhelmed by your opponent’s spirit? Pull yourselves together and march forward. Even if I’m your opponent. —Now, bring it on."
Cain,"Even if I’m your opponent. —Now, bring it on."
Soldier,Y-Yessir....!
Drummond,Cain! How many times must I tell you! These soldiers here no longer follow your command! I will give their orders!
Cain,You’re so picky.....
Drummond,You’re too relaxed! That’s why you were chased out of your rank as commanding officer!
Cain,"Okay, okay! Have it your way. Just make it quick. Go ahead, Your Excellency."
Drummond,"Ahem..... Go, get him.....!"
Narrator,(Footsteps)
Soldier,Aaaaargh.....!
Narrator,The soldiers raise their voices and rush at Cain.
Narrator,(Swords clashing)
Narrator,"I’m bewildered by the sudden uproar, but Cain battles so dashingly that I can’t take my eyes off of him. He dodges soldiers blindly swinging their blades one after another and beats them down with ease."
Akira,(Amazing... He’s so cool.....)
Narrator,That’s when somebody’s hand timidly tugs at my arm. His fingertips are cold.
???,.............
Akira,Um.......
???,"Ah.... I’m Heathcliff, an Eastern wizard. Please follow me."
Narrator,"I take one look at the boy named Heathcliff and my breath is taken away. He’s a beautiful boy — more beautiful than anyone I’ve ever seen on television, or online. He’s like a work of art, crafted with the most delicate workmanship. Heathcliff turns his eyes downward, as if to escape my gaze."
Heathcliff,This way.
Narrator,"I follow Heathcliff to a dark staircase, escaping the floor that has become a total battleground. I feel my anxiety growing — I know there were no spiral staircases in my apartment complex."
Akira,"U... Um, can I ask a question?"
Narrator,"Heathcliff looks at me over his shoulder as we’re halfway down the stairwell. His vivid eyes are like fine jewels. I’m mesmerized for an instant, but my expression soon turns to a frown. Heathcliff looks ill. Upon closer inspection, Cain, who is fighting on the floor above, also looks exhausted."
Akira,....Are you okay? You don’t look very good. .....Woa....h.
Narrator,"Heathcliff staggers out of nowhere, and I quickly reach out to support him. Breathing heavily, Heathcliff rests a hand on his forehead."
Heathcliff,....I apologize.... I’m almost entirely out of magic......
Akira,....Magic.....?
Heathcliff,We just came from our battle with the < Great Catastrophe >...... ....Cain is also at his limit.....
Soldier,Don’t let them go! Catch them!
Heathcliff,...............
Narrator,(Footsteps)
Narrator,The soldiers come chasing us from the floor above. Heathcliff leads me by the hand and we try to make our way to the lower floor. But a crowd approaches us from below.
Soldier,We’ve caught you in the middle! Now you can’t get away!
Heathcliff,"....Don’t worry, Sir Sage. I will protect you."
Akira,But you look so ill.....
Narrator,"Heathcliff holds up his hand in front of his chest. A gentle light begins to gather around his hand. Before I can register it, there’s a pocket watch in his palm."
Akira,(Wh-what was that!?)
Narrator,Heathcliff quietly grips the pocket watch and closes his eyes.
Heathcliff,<< Repsevaivulp Sonus >>
Narrator,In that moment—. The soldiers all freeze up like figurines.
Akira,Wh.....!?
Heathcliff,......agh.
Akira,A-are you okay!?
Narrator,"As if overwhelmed by vertigo, Heathcliff falls to one knee. He quickly nods and forces himself to stand back up."
Heathcliff,"...I’m all right.... Let’s hurry. The magic will come undone in an instant. We need to hurry, or else Mr. Faust will......"
Narrator,"I support Heath’s back while falling deeper into my confusion. He doesn’t look like he’s performing for a prank. This looks real. The same goes for the sharpness of the soldier’s swords, and for Cain, who hides his exhaustion as he fights on."
Cain,"Heath, are you all right!?"
Heathcliff,....I’m fine!
Akira,"(If it’s all real, then......) (What in the world is going on?)"
???,"The wind really lingers on your skin tonight. Like the touch of a lover bound to cause future troubles..... The Central tower is within sight. I wonder if Cain and Heathcliff are safe. Come now, stop getting distracted. I’ll leave you behind. Murr."
Murr,I’m headed over right now!
Heathcliff,"This way, Sir Sage."
Akira,Yes.....
Narrator,"Still in a daze, I follow Heathcliff as we weave our way through the crowd of soldiers, frozen stiff like figurines. We’re almost at the bottom of the stairwell when their fingers begin to twitch."
Heathcliff,.....The spell is wearing off......
Narrator,"In the next moment, the soldiers all begin to move at once."
Soldier,....Capture the Sage! Huh? He’s gone? Where’d he go!?
Soldier,"You idiot, he’s right behind you!"
Soldier,When did he get there!? We’re not letting you go.....!
Narrator,(Footsteps)
Narrator,The soldiers surround us.
Narrator,"That’s when a strange-smelling white smoke drifts into the scene from the window at the end of the stairs. It’s dazzlingly sweet, akin to wine."
Narrator,"I look up in surprise, and there, on the once-empty windowsill, sits a young man. He smiles gently, but there’s a mysterious, seductive air to him as well. Perhaps it’s because of the long pipe in his mouth."
???,Good evening.
Heathcliff,Shylock!
???,"My goodness, I can’t believe you. You and Cain are both pushing yourselves far past your limits.... You must’ve just barely hung onto your brooms to get here."
Heathcliff,"I had to, for Mr. Faust....."
???,I know. Leave the rest to us.
Narrator,The young man strokes Heathcliff’s pale cheek and smiles at me over Heathcliff’s shoulder.
???,"Pleased to meet you, Sir Sage. I am Shylock, a Western wizard."
Akira,....A wizard.....
Narrator,I’m shaken again; Shylock gives me a refined smile. He seductively brings the pipe to his lips.
Soldier,A-another wizard!
Soldier,D-don’t let him scare you! They should’ve used up all their power in the battle against the < Great Catastrophe >....!
Narrator,"Shylock simply breathes out a puff of smoke from his pipe. And the white smoke fills the room with a sweet, intoxicating scent. The soldiers all suddenly stumble on their feet — it’s as if they’re drunk."
Soldier,"Hehe..... Huh.....? Hey, isn’t this kinda fun......?"
Soldier,Heheh...... This bed looks real comfy......... I’ll just go to sleep......
Narrator,"Before I know it, the soldiers are all falling to the floor wearing delighted expressions. Shylock crosses his legs up high and brings his pipe away from his lips."
Shylock,Sweet dreams.
Narrator,That’s when Cain comes rushing down towards us from the stairs.
Cain,"Shylock, you saved us!"
Shylock,"You owe me one, all right? Treat me to a drink next time."
Cain,"Just one drink? I’ll stick around for the whole night. Sir Sage, let’s go."
Narrator,"Cain offers me his hand, but I can’t take it right away. I’m unsure of whether or not I should take his hand; my gaze wavers."
Akira,(Let’s go? Go where? Who are these people? Where am I?)
Narrator,"Cain doesn’t miss the brief flash of anxiety in my expression, and stops in his tracks. He shows no sign of exhaustion as he nods to me, gently and sincerely."
Cain,"Ah.... My bad. The sage comes from another world, right? That means you have no idea what’s going on. Of course you’d be scared — we’re asking you to come with us when you don’t even know where you are. ....Umm....."
Shylock,Cain. We don’t have time for you to explain everything about this world and the sage’s role in it all.
Cain,I know. But a knight doesn’t go about whisking clueless people away without explaining anything to them.
Narrator,Cain thinks for a moment before looking straight into my eyes.
Cain,"Akira. Let me give you the simple explanation. We need your power, and we’d like you to lend it to us. Why? Because we suffered a terrible loss. We were completely destroyed in an annual battle that we’d easily won every prior year. We were neither careless nor neglectful. The old guy back there is angry because he thinks we did a half-hearted job. But that’s not true. We didn’t even know what was happening — and we lost the battle, along with half of our comrades. I don’t want to lose anything else..... That’s why we need your help. Of course, that’s just our selfish desire. This isn’t your world, and I’m sure there are other things that you would rather be doing. You have the right to refuse, and nobody will blame you for making that choice. But we..... We truly need you. If you’re willing to come with us and lend us your power, then I’m willing to do anything. I will show you my utmost courage and sincerity; I will express my utmost gratitude and courtesy. This vow may be nothing but words — but I beg of you: Please, believe in us, and lend us your strength."
Narrator,"I don’t really understand what Cain is saying. But I truly feel his earnest sincerity from his words and gaze. I can’t tell if I’m living in a dream or a simulated reality, but I can tell that his feelings are real. If I take his words seriously, someone on the other end of the camera might laugh at me. But I have to lend him an ear."
Akira,...How am I supposed to lend you my strength?
Heathcliff,We want you to.... We want you to save Mr. Faust.
Akira,Mr. Faust....?
Cain,He’s our comrade. He’s on the brink of death. But you might be able to save him.
Akira,On the brink of death...? Why....
Shylock,He was gravely injured while protecting a comrade.
Heathcliff,"....Mr. Faust is my teacher..... If he hadn’t been there for me, I would’ve died....."
Narrator,A comrade on the brink of death..... I repeat those words in my mind. I still don’t understand what’s going on. But I can understand the deep sadness reflected in Heathcliff’s reddened eyes.
Heathcliff,"....Please, I beg of you.... Please save him....."
Narrator,I take a deep breath and nod.
Akira,I understand.... If there’s anything I can do to help.
Narrator,"A smile of relief spreads across Heathcliff’s face. I’m in awe; I didn’t realize he was a boy who could smile like this — with such pure, childlike innocence."
Heathcliff,"Thank you, Sir Sage......"
Drummond,Wait! You damn wizards! I won’t let you have the Sage....!
Narrator,"The bearded man and the meek-looking young man yell as they rush down the stairwell. The old man looks at me and shouts, as if chiding me:"
Drummond,"Sir Sage! You mustn't be fooled! Wizards are all irresponsible liars! They remorselessly deceive humans, and manipulate our hearts with strange powers! You must not believe the wizards!"
Narrator,"I turn around to look at the three of them. Cain furrows his brows in frustration, and Heathcliff looks visibly hurt. Shylock alone is smiling. He tilts his head and lets his pipe sway in his hand."
Shylock,"Let’s say that we are honest, and telling the truth. That would then make you a liar. In fact, you would be the very ""irresponsible liar"" you spoke of just moments ago."
Drummond,I serve my country! I am nothing like you frivolous lot!
Shylock,"Silence, Sir Drummond. You may think you are speaking with us, but you have no intention of holding a real conversation. The only feeling your words convey is the fact that you do not seem to be very fond of us. You would not believe our words even if they were true. And if we do lie, you would sigh a breath of relief. For you wish to believe that we — the wizards you so detest — are all liars. Then does it matter anymore what is true or what is false?"
Drummond,"....Aargh, quit with the word games! In any case, Sir Sage! You must not lend an ear to these wizards! You simply need to listen to us! I’m saying this for your own sake, Sir Sage!"
Narrator,"I frown at those words. The old man claims to be speaking in my best interests, but the only thing he’s been telling me is to listen to him. Cain asked me to help him — for his own sake and his comrades — even if it might not be in my best interest. I turn around to look at Cain."
Akira,I still don’t understand what’s going on.... But I will follow you.
Akira,I still don’t understand what’s going on.... But I will follow you.
Cain,Really!?
Heathcliff,Are you sure!?
Shylock,"Don’t act so surprised, both of you. Sir Sage decided to believe in us; we should be happy."
Narrator,"Shylock laughs wryly. Hearing that, Cain and Heathcliff also break out into smiles."
Cain,"We are happy. I’m just in awe — a human chose to believe in wizards, even though we only just met."
Heathcliff,"Thank you so much, Sir Sage! I will never forget your kindness!"
Drummond,"Y-you... Do you realize what a mistake you’re making!? Listen to me — wizards are wicked, arrogant, and selfish....."
Heathcliff,Say one more word and this wicked wizard will curse you.
Drummond,..........
Heathcliff,"These wicked and arrogant wizards are the ones who fought to protect this world. My teacher, my comrades — they fought and fell to protect the likes of you!"
Drummond,Th.... That’s......
Cock Robin,"S-Sir, you’ve gone too far."
Drummond,"Why are you taking their side!? All right then, I’m going to take you down by force!"
Shylock,Oh? How? Everyone seems to have departed to the land of dreams.
Drummond,"Heheh.... You fools! There are soldiers waiting for you outside! You won’t stand a chance against them, knowing how exhausted you are! It’s a massive army, equipped with weapons of magical technology....."
???,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
Akira,.......!?
Narrator,(Pop)
Narrator,"Suddenly, the old man disappears."
Narrator,"And in his place stands a mouse, surrounded by his clothes."
Mouse,Squeak! Squeak!
Narrator,"A young man climbs in through the window, picks the mouse up by its tail, and grins."
???,Meo~w. I’m gonna eat you.
Narrator,I hold my breath in surprise. Because he’s the young man I just met in the elevator.
Shylock,"What have you been doing all this time, Murr?"
Murr,I was busy saying goodbye to the moon!
Cain,To the moon? You’re as crazy as ever.
Narrator,"I’m bewildered. His name and face are the same, but he seems like a completely different person from the man I met earlier. Earlier, he was a brilliant gentleman; now, he’s like a mischievous stray cat."
Heathcliff,We can talk later. Everyone hurry!
Murr,Got it!
Mouse,Squeak~! Squeak!
Narrator,"Murr hurls the mouse through the air, and Cock Robin scrambles to catch it."
Cock Robin,"Um, about the minister....."
Shylock,He’ll turn back to normal after half a day.
Murr,"Hi, Sir Sage, I’m the Western wizard Murr! Have you ever flown?"
Akira,Flown....!? Huh....!?
Murr,Then come with me! This way!
Akira,Whoa....!?
Cain,"Stop, Murr!"
Murr,<< Eanul Rambul >>!
Narrator,"When Murr utters those mysterious words—. Out of nowhere, a broomstick appears in his hand. He grabs it with one hand and pulls my arm by the other. And we leap out of the closest window."
Akira,.....!?
Narrator,"My body floats into the air. And in the next moment, we plummet at a great speed."
Akira,Aaaa....h!
Narrator,"The cold night air rushes towards my body. As I fall headfirst from a tall, tall tower. A likewise upside-down but smiling Murr appears in front of my eyes as I scream."
Murr,"Hey, hey, do you think you’re gonna die? How does that feel? Is it thrilling? Is it exciting?"
Cain,"Murr, that’s enough! What are we going to do if something happens to Sir Sage!?"
Murr,What will we do?
Cain,Don’t ask me!
Murr,"Fine, I get it! Sir Sage, hang onto me!"
Narrator,(Woosh)
Narrator,"I grab onto Murr’s arm, and he nimbly hops onto his broomstick. The next moment, we’re speeding upwards high into the night sky. We’re soaring through the wind and flying through the starlit night. Fearfully, I turn my eyes downward and see nothing but unfamiliar woods and castles sprawling across the land below."
Akira,....Where.....!?
Murr,Did you lose something? Have you checked the insides of your pockets?
Akira,"W-where is Tokyo, Japan!?"
Murr,Who knows? Why don’t you look for a new one? Here we go~!
Narrator,(Woosh)
Cain,"Murr! Don’t be so reckless! You’re carrying the Sage with you, you know!?"
Narrator,"I cling to Murr’s body as we cut against the cold air, flying through the sky like a bird. I turn around and spot a tower — much like the Tokyo Tower — glittering within the pitch-black night. We had leapt out of that tower. As we flee through the sky, my heart races with both fear and excitement. I know people who fly on broomsticks. They’re wizards."
Akira,(Don’t tell me.... They’re real wizards!?)
Cain,.....! Careful! It’s the << Trail of Flowershards >> !
Heathcliff,"A cluster of flower petals, spreading through the entire night sky like a high wave..... Is this the << Trail of Flowershards >> which appears when the world is restoring itself!? Should we go around it....!?"
Murr,"Let’s dive right into it! You want to touch it too, right, Sir Sage!"
Akira,You can touch it!?
Cain,"Hey, hey, hey, hold on!"
Shylock,"Stop it, Murr."
Murr,It’s fine! Come on! Just reach out!
Akira,.....Ah......
Narrator,"A glittering wave of rainbow flower petals draws close to me. I reach out, my heart racing. The moment my fingertips brush a petal, it bursts into a sparkling powder and dissipates like magic dust."
Akira,.....!
Heathcliff,...It’s beautiful......
Shylock,Is everyone all right?
Cain,Yeah. What an amazing sight......
Murr,"Ahahaha! See, aren’t you glad you touched it? Life is a journey! You’ll meet countless, wonderful, once-in-a-lifetime experiences."
Narrator,Their bodies shine with light; it’s as if we’re dancing with the galaxy as their laughter echoes through the night. And we fly on to our destination.
