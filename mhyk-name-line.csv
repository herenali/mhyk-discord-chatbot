Cain,Why?
Bradley,You're asking why? Who would go against Oz's orders? He'd crush you like a tomato if you even dared to defy him.

Heathcliff,Mithra...... Owen...... Those two are scary......

Shylock,"It’s certainly not common. But I could certainly say the same for exchanging eyeballs, or tying a ghost to this world using magic."
Bradley,Hah. What a bunch of weirdos.
Shylock,I’m quite fond of you all. Be it wine or humans — bizarre abnormalities carry stories that are just as rich as those of outstanding excellencies.
Cain,You really are a Western wizard.
Shylock,And you are very much like a Central wizard — you’re honest to your very core.
Akira,"Um.... when you say ""like a Central wizard"" or ""Western wizard,"" what does that all mean?"
Snow,There are five countries in this world,"Central, North, West, East, and South."
White,A wizard’s disposition varies depending on the country they reside in. The previous sage recorded it in the sage’s manual.

Akira,OJT.....?
White,"We learned this phrase from the previous sage. OJT stands for ""On-the-Job Training""",you learn through example.

White,A discussion is called a meeting.
Snow,The mediator is called a trainer. Though we call them teachers.

Shino,Those guys are so excitable..... Are they from the South?
Figaro,And you’re the hot-blooded kid from earlier. Are you by chance the Eastern wizard Shino?
Shino,I am. How did you know?
Figaro,"I heard from a friend of mine that there was a young, powerful wizard in the East, and you seemed to fit the description."
Shino,Description?
Figaro,Small and—....
Shino,What’s your name?
Figaro,I’m the Southern wizard Figaro.
Shino,"Figaro. I’ll get real tall next year, and look down on that head of yours."

Rutile,Here we go. I’ll help you guys clean up. Where should I put this chair?

Lennox,What’s wrong?
Rutile,"He was injured, so I healed his wounds. It looks like everyone is hurt all over."
Lennox,"Well, getting injured is a soldier’s job, after all."

Riquet,There’s a strange mark on my forehead — the fact that it’s so prominent is causing me trouble. Are you an authorized party?

Chloe,Huh? You can erase this thing? Rustica said you couldn’t.
Riquet,Eh? I can’t have that......
Chloe,"I feel you. Sometimes you just want to switch up your style — I want it to match my outfit for the day, you know?"
Riquet,"Dressing up is an extravagance for the vain. Wizards, who are the disciples of God, need to be frugal......"
Chloe,What’s a disciple of god.....? You don’t like dressing up.....?
Riquet,I see you’ve been tainted by worldly desires. How tragic.
Chloe,S-sorry......
Riquet,Where is this person in charge called Mister Rustica?
Chloe,Person in charge?
Riquet,"You heard about this mark on my forehead from Mister Rustica, right?"

Soldier,"Yes. It seems like he’s been summoned to the magic headquarters! Now that Prince Arthur is one of the chosen wizards, the people must feel more relieved!"

Riquet,Huh?
Nero,How old are you?
Riquet,I’m sixteen.
Nero,You seem younger than that..... Must be because you were locked away all this time....
Riquet,I wasn’t locked away. They were simply protecting me from the corruption of the outside world. They’re all very kind people.
Nero,"......Got it. Feel free to eat as much as you want. There’s plenty to go around for seconds, too."
Riquet,"Yes, thank you!"
Mitile,Riquet!
Riquet,Mitile.....
Mitile,"Ah... Hello Sir Sage. Mister Nero, too — breakfast was delicious!"
Nero,Thanks.
Mitile,"Riquet, when you’re finished eating, let’s head to the courtyard together. My brother will be teaching lessons!"
Riquet,Rutile will? Am I allowed to join you?
Mitile,"Of course! We’re friends now, Riquet."
Riquet,Friends..... Got it. I’ll join you then.
Mitile,"Ah.... Sir Sage, Mister Nero, would you like to join us too?"
Nero,"I’m good. Study hard, guys."

Mitile,"Got it! Watch me, Riquet. ""Mitile""...... This is my name."
Riquet,M-i-t-i-l-e. Mitile. Got it! I’ll try writing it out.

Shylock,Cain certainly enjoys leaping ahead and grabbing the reins — perhaps it’s because he was the former general of the knights. Let’s follow his lead.
Cock Robin,"Ah, wait for me! What should I do.....!?"
Figaro,"You can take the elevator. The headquarters’ tower connects to the Central tower, right?"
Snow,Unfortunately it doesn’t seem to be functioning. Something might have happened to the Central tower.
Rutile,"Then I can take you. I’ll make sure you don’t fall, so please hop onto the back of my broom."
Cock Robin,Th-thank you! I’d feel perfectly comfortable riding behind a wizard as kind as you!
Rutile,Leave it to me! I’ll fly even faster than a frigate bird!
Cock Robin,Huh?
Figaro,"Hey, good luck. Rutile is usually very calm and gentle, but he’s an absolute speed demon when he’s flying."

Shino,"I asked a bunch of people, but they all said they didn’t sense an earthquake. Something else must've caused the tower to collapse."
Heathcliff,"Where are you going, Shino?"
Shino,I'm going to check out the cemetery.
Heathcliff,Right now!?
Shino,"Yeah. You're all staying the night here, right? I'll be back by morning."
Heathcliff,It's dangerous to go alone.
Akira,"It looks like everyone’s rooms are ready. Oh, Heath, Shino, is something the matter?"
Shino,I'm going to find out what monster brought that tower down.
Akira,A monster...? So it really wasn't an earthquake.....

Shino,Please ask them about it. I'm headed off.
Heathcliff,"Hey, wait!"
Shino,What?
Heathcliff,....... It's dangerous. I'll go with you.
Shino,Heath? Headed to a cemetery? In the middle of the night? Did you forget that you’re afraid of ghosts despite being a wizard?
Heathcliff,Shut up.
Akira,I’m worried about just the two of you going alone. I’ll come along too.
Heathcliff,"But Sir Sage, it's even more dangerous for you."
Shino,You're not going to be of any help.
Heathcliff,Shino.

White,"But once we're through with the inauguration ceremony this afternoon, we should have some room to breathe."

Snow,Hm.... I feel like I almost have it.

Shino,"But why? If anyone speaks poorly of a general, he can just chop off their heads. That way, nobody will start rumors about you."
Heathcliff,Listen......
Arthur,"Haha..... I don’t know about that reasoning. People speak ill of me, even though I'm a prince. There’s really nothing that will shield you from rumors."

Shino,Huh? What about waving at everyone from the balcony?
Heathcliff,It looks like there’s a problem. Let's be patient and wait.
Shino,"....Fine. That means we can investigate as much as we want without worrying about the time. Let's go, Heath."
Heathcliff,"Shino! I’m sorry, Sir Sage. Please excuse us."
✦,✧,☾,✧,✦
Heathcliff,How are you planning on continuing this investigation anyway?
Shino,"Anything will do, so long as it brings us recognition."
Heathcliff,"Recognition.... Shino, were you serious about making me an Eastern Country general....?"
Shino,Of course I was. You'd never go for a title like that on your own.
Heathcliff,"Shino, you don't know what you’re talking about.... If I become a general, what are you going to do if we go to a war with Central Country?"

Shino,"When that happens, I'll seize this entire castle and offer it to you."
Heathcliff,......Shino......
Shino,I'll destroy anything in this world to create a path where you can walk with your head high. I'll steal anything and grant it all to you.

Heathcliff,....The way we used to be....?
Shino,......You always used to be so happy whenever I brought you something.
Heathcliff,B-but.... You’re talking about flowers and squirrels!?
Shino,A generalship and a castle are the same sort of thing.
Heathcliff,They're not the same!
Shino,"They are the same, because they all suit you. They’ll also please Master and Mistress. Anyway, for starters, let's secure our prestige in Central Country."

Akira,Murr... And the Western wizards....
Rustica,"Good morning, Sir Sage. Last night was simply wonderful."
Chloe,It was so fun! I even made a new friend~. I'm going to make her a scarf!
Shylock,What were the two of you discussing?
Akira,"Well...... There have been all kinds of mysterious incidents occurring at this place called the Lunar Eclipse Palace, and Mister Cock Robin seems to have gone missing because of it."
Rustica,He got lost in a palace? It must be quite huge.
Chloe,"He said there were mysterious incidents going on, so maybe it’s all under a spell?"
Shylock,"There were many bizarre items in that palace, after all."
Akira,Are you familiar with the palace?
Shylock,"Murr was very fond of it, you see. He would sneak in without permission, browse around without permission, steal items without permission, and also add items without permission."
Drummond,H-he did what with the great artifacts of our country!?
Shylock,"Please direct your complaints at Murr. But you want us to look for the missing Cock Robin, right?"
Drummond,....I do. Could you please save him?
Shylock,"Well, so long as you don't mind relying on these irresponsible, lying wizards."
Drummond,............. Of course not. I beg you.
Shylock,Understood.

Murr,Yeah! Let's go!
Akira,Oh...... P-please wait! Can I come along too? I’m worried about Mister Cock Robin......
Murr,Sure! Wanna hop on my broom?

Shylock,The Lunar Eclipse Palace lies just beyond that forest. We’ll be there soon enough.
Chloe,The weather is so nice today! It’s perfect for flying.
Rustica,"It's also the perfect weather to host a tea party in the garden. We can sing and dance, round and round."
Murr,"Sounds fun! Hey, Sir Sage, do you like to sing?"
Akira,"I'm not very good at it, so...."
Murr,"It doesn’t matter whether you’re good or bad! The real question is, do you like it or hate it?"
Rustica,"That's right. Sir Sage, if you like something — whether it’s singing or dancing — you should enjoy it to your heart’s content."

Akira,....Who are you....?
Murr,Don't ask the same question twice; that's boring. Try a different approach. You can find the answer.
Akira,....You're a different person than the Murr I was with? Or are you the real Murr?

Akira,The shards of his soul take physical form... So this is Murr's bizarre injury....
Murr,Bizarre injury. That's an interesting phrase. I’m quite fond of it.
Akira,"Um... So, there are Murrs like you all over the world — if we gather them all, will Murr return to his former self?"
Murr,Perhaps. But I can't say I like the idea. Murr is too intelligent; his brain can never stay in one place.

Akira,I don't think I can answer that question for you.....
Murr,I see. To whom do you think I should make my demands known? Do soul shards have human rights?
Akira,W... Why did you kidnap Mister Cock Robin? Because you didn’t want him to get in the way of your research?
Murr,I didn't kidnap him. I simply stopped him from wandering further into the palace. Because therein lie the traces of a powerful spell.
Akira,A powerful spell?

Cain,Prince Arthur hasn't sent word from the Central capital yet. I wonder how he’s doing...... Should I go check on him in secret?
Shylock,I would recommend against it. We have essentially been ordered to quarantine ourselves here.
Cain,But we need to find the culprit behind the incident at the Lunar Eclipse Palace....
Shylock,"Of course. That is why, until things calm down, we need to do all the investigating we can here at the magic headquarters."
Cain,Investigating? At the magic headquarters......? Wh-what's with this mountain of massive books!?
Shylock,Please research the Umbra Volans.

Snow,We're not old geezers!
White,We’re not old geezers~!
Figaro,"And we still don't know anything about the piece of equipment that belonged to the Magical Technology Corps, right?"
Shylock,"Even if they’d found anything, they might not report it to us. For it could very well cause a scandal for Central Country."
Figaro,"I'd welcome a scandal or two — otherwise, they're going to start hunting wizards."
Akira,You mentioned that before. What does that mean?
Figaro,Magical technology is fueled by mana stones. Mana stones are the stones of wizards — they contain their magic powers.

Snow,"He can speak to beasts, such as wolves. He was a huntsman, after all. He's also skilled at absorbing magic."
White,"Wizards usually obtain their magic from nature, but Owen is a bit special."

Shino,"Snow, White. What about the identity of the Umbra Volans?"
Snow,< The Omen of Umbra Volans >.
Shino,The Omen......?
White,A spell that was sealed away in ancient times...... The Festival of the City of the Dead.
Snow,"It is a large-scale summoning spell where the dead of the lost city are brought back to life, and every living being is offered up as fodder for their revival."
White,< The Omen of Umbra Volans > is the bird that symbolizes the beginning of this festival.
Snow,Judging from the time it appeared — the dead should begin coming back to life tonight.
Cain,......Oh god...... But wasn’t the ritual performed at the Lunar Eclipse Palace supposed to summon the moon?
Snow,"They offered old human bones instead of living sacrifices, right? That's why the ritual transformed."
White,Nicholas is a military man; his job is to protect the people. I suppose even he could not gather living humans.
Heathcliff,"But according to the Western wizards, the same kind of ritual was conducted all over the world......"
Shino,Some of them must've actually used living humans. This Nova guy might have guided them from the shadows.

Mithra,What a rude woman.
Snow,"On the other hand, the Southern brothers grew up to be such good children. Rutile and Mitile are both so amiable."
Mithra,Rutile and Mitile? Do those two know Tiretta?

Akira,We couldn’t persuade him......
Snow,"No, I think that’s not quite true."
Akira,What do you mean?
White,Judging from how panicked Mithra was...... He might have made some kind of promise with Tiretta.
Akira,Promise......?
Snow,"Wizards use magic with their hearts. If they betray their hearts...... If they break a promise or a contract, they lose their magic."
White,"That is why wizards do not make promises. Because when a wizard makes a promise he cannot keep, the mysterious powers he once controlled refuse to do his bidding."
Snow,Tiretta predicted her own death before she gave birth to Mitile.
White,There are only so many promises a mother would ask a powerful wizard to make if she foresaw her own death.

Rutile,"......By the way, did we ever figure out what Mister Mithra's bizarre injury is?"
Murr,"You're right, Mithra’s the only one we haven’t figured out yet. Mine is that lots of me's appear!"
Mithra,"I don't care. More importantly, I'm so sleepy......"
Shino,Then go to sleep.
Mithra,"I can't fall asleep, you see. That's why I haven't slept for days."
Arthur,That sounds horrible...... When was the last time you slept?
Mithra,The last time......

Mithra,......Maybe......
Murr,So dense......
Shino,So dense.......
Rutile,I'll give you some goods that will help you get a good night’s sleep.
